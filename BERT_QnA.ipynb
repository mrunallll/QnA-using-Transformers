By Henry JamesII. By George Pellissier, 1. The Siege of Berlin2. The Last Class—The Story of a Little Alsatian3. The Child Spy4. The Game of Billiards5. The Bad Zouave, Biographical Note, ALPHONSE DAUDET was born at Nîmes in the south of France on May 13, 1840. His father was anunsuccessful silk manufacturer, and his boyhood was far from happy. After a period of schooling atLyons, he became at sixteen usher in a school, but before the end of the following year he abandoned aprofession in which he found only misery. Going up to Paris he joined his elder brother, Ernest, who wasthen trying to get a foothold in journalism. At eighteen he published a volume of poems, “LesAmoureuses,” wrote for the “Figaro,” and began experimenting with playwriting. He attracted theattention of the Duc de Morny, who made him one of his secretaries and in various ways helped him to astart in life.  His first notable success came in 1866 with his “Lettres de mon Moulin,” a series of sketches andstories of great charm and delicacy, and this was followed up by a longer work, “Le petit chose,” apathetic fiction based upon his own unhappy youth. In 1872 he produced the first of his three volumes onthe amazing “Tartarin of Tarascon,” probably the most vital of all his creations. In “Fromont jeune etRisler aîné” he created another great character, Delobelle, the broken-down actor, and he took captive thereading world by his combination of humor and pathos, and the vividness of his portraits of types. Pathoswas again the chief characteristic of “Jack,” in which the life of a neglected boy at a school which recallsthe establishment of Mr. Squeers is not the only parallel between Daudet and Dickens.  Daudet was now a successful writer of established reputation, and through the seventies and eighties hewrote a succession of novels of a considerable variety of theme. Thus he dealt with the Paris ofdethroned monarchs in “Les Rois en exil”; with new millionaires in “Le Nabab”; with the talkative typeof his native South in “Numa Roumestan,” satirizing the statesman Gambetta; with the demimonde in“Sapho”; while in “L’Immortel” he drew a scathing picture of the French Academy, which neverhonored itself by electing him to membership. “Tartarin” reappeared in all his buoyancy in “Tartarin surles Alpes,” and, less successfully as a colonist in “Port-Tarascon.” Some volumes of reminiscences, aconsiderable number of short stories, some delightful tales for children, and a few plays complete the listof his more important writings. He died at Paris on December 17, 1897.  Daudet was especially distinguished for his style. He wrote with a great impression of ease, yet heobtained an effect of great brilliance and felicity. He belonged to the realistic school, and though heachieved a very living sense of actuality he escaped the cynicism and brutality that marked the work ofsome of his colleagues.  None of his work is more perfect of its kind than his short stories, and the collection called “Contes dulundi” from which the following examples are taken exhibit his power of restrained pathos at its height.The horrors of the Franco-Prussian War have been more terribly pictured on some larger canvases, butno one has etched with more delicacy and sensitiveness the small private tragedies of that great disaster.“The Siege of Berlin,” “The Last Class,” and “The Bad Zouave” are not only classics of the art of theshort story; they contain the essence of French patriotism., W. A. N., Criticisms and Interpretations, I. By Henry James, THE CHARM of Daudet’s talent comes from its being charged to an extraordinary degree with histemperament, his feelings, his instincts, his natural qualities. This, of course, is a charm in a style onlywhen nature has been generous. To Alphonse Daudet she has been exceptionally so; she has placed in hishand an instrument of many chords. A delicate nervous organisation, active and indefatigable in spite ofits delicacy, and familiar with emotion of almost every kind, equally acquainted with pleasure and withpain; a light, quick, joyous, yet reflective, imagination, a faculty of seeing images, making images, atevery turn, of conceiving everything in the visible form, in the plastic spirit; an extraordinary sensibilityto all the impressions of life and a faculty of language which is in perfect harmony with his wonderfulfineness of perception—these are some of the qualities of which he is the happy possessor, and whichmake his equipment for the work he has undertaken exceedingly rich.—From “Partial Portraits” (1888)., Criticisms and Interpretations, II. By George Pellissier, DAUDET works in a sort of fever. Even before beginning to write his books, he has related, acted, andalmost “lived” them. This habit responds to a necessity of his nature, and this he also constitutes hisprocess of composition. The original sketch is only an improvisation, but with the second version beginswhat he calls the painful part of his labor. He first abandons himself to his fancy, giving free rein to histroubadour instincts. The subject urges him on and outstrips him; his hand glides rapidly over the paperwithout writing all the words, or even pausing to punctuate, in the effort to follow the fever of his toilingbrain by hastily stenographing ideas and sentiments. Only with that “trembling of the fingers,” with hima sign of inspiration, does he take up his pen. He at once launches into the full current of the action. Ashis figures are already “on foot in his mind,” he loses no time in introducing them in full activity. Thegreater part of his novels consists in a series of pictures or episodes which pass in file beneath our eyes.There are no preludes either at the outset or in passing from one chapter to another; he explains thesituation by a word, leaving the reader to imagine such events as are not adapted to an entirely actualmise en scène. He renders only what moves his heart and sets his nerves in vibration—what is dramatic,picturesque, and animated in human affairs.—From “The Literary Movement in France in the NineteenthCentury” (1893)., 1. The Siege of Berlin, WE were going up Avenue des Champs-Elysées with Dr. V——, asking the shell-riddled walls, and thesidewalks torn up by grape-shot, for the story of the siege of Paris, when, just before we reached theRond-point de l’Etoile, the doctor stopped and, pointing to one of the great corner houses so proudlygrouped about the Arc de Triomphe, said to me:  “Do you see those four closed windows up there on that balcony? In the early days of August, thatterrible August of last year, so heavily laden with storms and disasters, I was called there to see a case ofapoplexy. It was the apartment of Colonel Jouve, a cuirassier of the First Empire, an old enthusiast on thesubject of glory and patriotism, who had come to live on the Champs-Élysées, in an apartment with abalcony, at the outbreak of the war. Guess why? In order to witness the triumphant return of our troops.Poor old fellow! The news of Wissembourg reached him just as he was leaving the table. When he readthe name of Napoleon at the foot of that bulletin of defeat, he fell like a log.  “I found the former cuirassier stretched out at full length on the carpet, his face covered with blood, andas lifeless as if he had received a blow on the head from a poleaxe. He must have been very tall when hewas standing; lying there, he looked enormous. Handsome features, magnificent teeth, a fleece of curlywhite hair, eighty years with the appearance of sixty. Beside him was his granddaughter, on her kneesand bathed in tears. She looked like him. One who saw them side by side might have taken them for twobeautiful Greek medallions, struck from the same die, one of which was old and earth-coloured, a littleroughened on the edges, the other resplendent and clean-cut, in all the brilliancy and smoothness of afresh impression.  “The child’s grief touched me. Daughter and granddaughter of soldiers, her father was on MacMahon’sstaff, and the image of that tall old man stretched out before her evoked in her mind another image noless terrible. I comforted her as best I could, but in reality I had little hope. We had to do with a case ofcomplete paralysis on one side, and at eighty years of age few people recover from it. For three days thepatient lay in the same state of inanition and stupor. Then the news of Reichshofen reached Paris. Youremember in what a strange way it came. Up to the evening, we all believed in a great victory, twentythousand Prussians killed and the Prince Royal a prisoner. I know not by what miracle, what magneticcurrent, an echo of that national rejoicing sought out our poor deaf-mute in the depths of his paralysis;but the fact is that on that evening, when I approached his bed, I did not find the same man there. His eyewas almost clear, his tongue less heavy. He had the strength to smile at me, and he stammered twice:  “‘Vic-to-ry!’  “And as I gave him details of the grand exploit of MacMahon, I saw that his features relaxed and hisface lighted up.  “When I left the room, the girl was waiting for me at the door, pale as death. She was sobbing.  “‘But he is saved!’ I said, taking her hands.  “The unhappy child hardly had the courage to reply. The true report of Reichshofen had been placarded;MacMahon in retreat, the whole army crushed. We gazed at each other in consternation. She was indespair, thinking of her father. I trembled, thinking of the old man. He certainly could not stand this freshshock. And yet what were we to do? Leave him his joy, and the illusions which had revived him? But inthat case we must lie.  “‘Very well, I will lie!’ said the heroic girl, quickly wiping away her tears; and with radiant face sheentered her grandfather’s chamber.  “It was a hard task that she had undertaken. The first few days she had no great difficulty. The goodman’s brain was feeble, and he allowed himself to be deceived like a child. But with returning health hisideas became clearer. We had to keep him posted concerning the movement of the armies, to draw upmilitary bulletins for him. Really, it was pitiful to see that lovely child leaning night and day over hermap of Germany, pinning little flags upon it, and struggling to lay out a glorious campaign: Bazainebesieging Berlin, Froissart in Bavaria, MacMahon on the Baltic. For all this she asked my advice, and Iassisted her as well as I could; but it was the grandfather who was especially useful to us in thatimaginary invasion. He had conquered Germany so many times under the First Empire! He knew all thestrokes beforehand: ‘Now this is where they will go. Now this is what they will do’; and his anticipationswere always realised, which did not fail to make him very proud.  “Unlucky it was of no avail for us to take cities and win battles; we never went quickly enough for him.That old man was insatiable! Every day, when I arrived, I learned of some new military exploit.  “‘Doctor, we have taken Mayence,’ the girl would say to me, coming to meet me with a heart-brokensmile, and I would hear through the door a joyous voice shouting to me:  “‘They are getting on! They are getting on! In a week we shall be in Berlin!’  “At that moment the Prussians were only a week’s march from Paris. We asked ourselves at first if itwould be better to take him into the provinces; but as soon as we were outside the city, the state of thecountry would have told him everything, and I considered him still too weak, too much benumbed by hisgreat shock, to let him know the truth. So we decided to remain.  “The first day of the investment of Paris, I went up to their rooms, I remember, deeply moved, with thatagony at the heart which the closed gates, the fighting under the walls, and our suburbs turned intofrontiers, gave us all. I found the good man seated on his bed, proud and jubilant.  “‘Well,’ he said, ‘so the siege has begun!’  “I gazed at him in blank amazement.  “‘What, colonel! you know?’  “His granddaughter turned towards me:  “‘Why, yes, doctor, that’s the great news. The siege of Berlin has begun.’  “As she said this, she plied her needle with such a sedate and placid air! How could he have suspectedanything? He could not hear the guns of the forts. He could not see our unfortunate Paris, all in confusionand dreadful to behold. What he saw from his bed was a section of the Arc de Triomphe, and in his room,about him, a collection of bric-a-brac of the First Empire, well adapted to maintain his illusion. Portraitsof marshals, engravings of battles, the King of Rome in a baby’s dress, tall consoles adorned with coppertrophies, laden with imperial relics, medals, bronzes, a miniature of St. Helena, under a globe, picturesrepresenting the same lady all becurled, in a ball-dress of yellow, with leg-of-mutton sleeves and brighteyes;—and all these things: consoles, King of Rome, marshals, yellow ladies, with the high-necked,short-waisted dresses, the bestarched stiffness, which was the charm of 1806. Gallant colonel! It was thatatmosphere of victories and conquests, even more than anything we could say to him, that made himbelieve so innocently in the siege of Berlin.  “From that day our military operations were much simplified. To take Berlin was only a matter ofpatience. From time to time, when the old man was too much bored, we would read him a letter from hisson—an imaginary letter, of course, for nothing was allowed to enter Paris, and since Sedan,MacMahon’s aide-de-camp had been sent to a German fortress. You can imagine the despair of that poorchild, without news from her father, knowing that he was a prisoner, in need of everything, perhaps sick,and she obliged to represent him as writing joyful letters, a little short, perhaps, but such as a soldier onthe field might be expected to write, always marching forward through a conquered country. Sometimesher strength gave way; then they were without news for weeks. But the old man became anxious, couldnot sleep. Thereupon a letter from Germany would speedily arrive, which she would bring to his bedsideand read joyously, forcing back her tears. The colonel would listen religiously, smile with a knowing air,approve, criticise, and explain to us the passages that seemed a little confused. But where he wasespecially grand was in the replies that he sent to his son. ‘Never forget that you are a Frenchman,’ hewould say to him. ‘Be generous to those poor people. Don’t make the invasion too hard for them.’ Andthere were recommendations without end, admirable preachments upon respect for the proprieties, thecourtesy which should be shown to the ladies, a complete code of military honour for the use ofconquerors. He interspersed also some general considerations upon politics, the conditions of peace to beimposed upon the vanquished. Thereupon I must say that he was not exacting.  “‘A war indemnity, and nothing more. What is the use of taking their provinces? Is it possible to turnGermany into France?’  “He dictated this in a firm voice; and one was conscious of such candour in his words, of such a noble,patriotic faith, that it was impossible not to be moved while listening to him.  “Meanwhile the siege went on—not the siege of Berlin, alas! It was the time of intense cold, of thebombardment, of epidemics and of famine. But, thanks to our care, to our efforts, to the unwearyingaffection which multiplied itself about him, the old man’s serenity was not disturbed for an instant. Tothe very end I was able to obtain white bread and fresh meat for him. There was none for anybody buthim, to be sure; and you can imagine nothing more touching than those breakfasts of the grandfather, soinnocently selfish—the old man seated on his bed, fresh and smiling, with a napkin at his chin, and hisgranddaughter beside him, a little pale because of privations, guiding his hand, helping him to drink, andto eat all those forbidden good things. Then, enlivened by the repast, in the comfort of his warm room,the winter wind whistling outside and the snow eddying about his windows, the ex-cuirassier wouldrecall his campaigns in the north and would describe to us for the hundredth time that terrible retreatfrom Russia, when they had nothing to eat but frozen biscuit and horseflesh.  “‘Do you understand that, my love? We had horseflesh!’  “I rather think that she did understand it. For two months she had had nothing else. From that day,however, as the period of convalescence drew near, our task about the patient became more difficult.That numbness of all his senses, of all his members, which had served us so well hitherto, began todisappear. Two or three times, the terrible volleys from Porte Maillot had made him jump, with his earspricked up like a hunting-dog; we were obliged to invent a final victory of Bazaine under the walls ofBerlin, and guns fired in his honour at the Invalides. Another day when his bed had been moved to thewindow—it was, I believe, the Thursday of Buzenval—he saw large numbers of National Guardscollected on Avenue de la Grande Armée.  “‘What are all those troops?’ asked the good man; and we heard him mutter between his teeth:  “‘Poorly set up! Poorly set up!’  “That was all; but we understood that we must take great precautions thenceforth. Unluckily we did nottake enough.  “One evening when I arrived, the girl came to me in great trouble.  “‘They are to march into the city to-morrow,’ she said.  “Was the grandfather’s door open? In truth, on thinking it over afterwards, I remembered that his facewore an extraordinary expression that night. It is probable that he had overheard us. But we were talkingof the Prussians; and the good man was thinking of the French, of that triumphal entry which he had beenawaiting so long—MacMahon marching down the avenue amid flowers and flourishes of trumpets, hisson beside him, and he, the old colonel, on his balcony, in full uniform as at Lutzen, saluting the tornflags and the eagles blackened by powder.  “Poor Father Jouve! He had imagined doubtless that we intended to prevent him from witnessing thatparade of our troops, in order to avoid too great excitement. So he was very careful not to mention it toany one; but the next day, at the very hour when the Prussian battalions entered hesitatingly upon thelong road which leads from Porte Maillot to the Tuileries, the window up there opened softly, and thecolonel appeared on the balcony, with his helmet, his long sword, all the glorious old array of one ofMilhaud’s cuirassiers. I wonder still what effort of the will, what sudden outburst of life had placed himthus upon his feet and in his harness. This much is sure, that he was there, standing behind the rail,amazed to find the broad avenues so silent, the blinds of the houses closed, Paris as gloomy as a hugelazaretto, flags everywhere, but such strange flags, white with little crosses, and no one to go to meet oursoldiers.  “For a moment he might have thought that he was mistaken.  “But no! Yonder, behind the Arc de Triomphe, there was a confused rumbling, a black line approachingin the rising sunlight. Then, little by little, the points of the helmets gleamed, the little drums of Jenabegan to beat, and beneath the Arc de Triomphe, while the heavy tramp of the regiments and the clashingof the sabres beat time, Schubert’s Triumphal March burst forth!  “Thereupon in the deathlike silence of the square, a cry rang out, a terrible cry: ‘To arms! To arms! ThePrussians!’ and the four uhlans of the vanguard saw up yonder, on the balcony, a tall old man wave hisarms, stagger, and fall. That time, Colonel Jouve was really dead.”, 2. The Last Class—The Story of a Little Alsatian, I WAS very late for school that morning, and I was terribly afraid of being scolded, especially asMonsieur Hamel had told us that he should examine us on participles, and I did not know the first thingabout them. For a moment I thought of staying away from school and wandering about the fields. It wassuch a warm, lovely day. I could hear the blackbirds whistling on the edge of the wood, and in theRippert field, behind the sawmill, the Prussians going through their drill. All that was much moretempting to me than the rules concerning participles; but I had the strength to resist, and I ran as fast as Icould to school.  As I passed the mayor’s office, I saw that there were people gathered about the little board on whichnotices were posted. For two years all our bad news had come from that board—battles lost,conscriptions, orders from headquarters; and I thought without stopping:  “What can it be now?”  Then, as I ran across the square, Wachter the blacksmith, who stood there with his apprentice, readingthe placard, called out to me:  “Don’t hurry so, my boy; you’ll get to your school soon enough!”  I thought that he was making fun of me, and I ran into Monsieur Hamel’s little yard all out of breath.  Usually, at the beginning of school, there was a great uproar which could be heard in the street, desksopening and closing, lessons repeated aloud in unison, with our ears stuffed in order to learn quicker, andthe teacher’s stout ruler beating on the desk:  “A little more quiet!”  I counted on all this noise to reach my bench unnoticed; but as it happened, that day everything wasquiet, like a Sunday morning. Through the open window I saw my comrades already in their places, andMonsieur Hamel walking back and forth with the terrible iron ruler under his arm. I had no open the doorand enter, in the midst of that perfect silence. You can imagine whether I blushed and whether I wasafraid!  But no! Monsieur Hamel looked at me with no sign of anger and said very gently:  “Go at once to your seat, my little Frantz; we were going to begin without you.”  I stepped over the bench and sat down at once at my desk. Not until then, when I had partly recoveredfrom my fright, did I notice that our teacher had on his handsome blue coat, his plaited ruff, and the blacksilk embroidered breeches, which he wore only on days of inspection or of distribution of prizes.Moreover, there was something extraordinary, something solemn about the whole class. But whatsurprised me most was to see at the back of the room, on the benches which were usually empty, somepeople from the village sitting, as silent as we were: old Hauser with his three-cornered hat, theex-mayor, the ex-postman, and others besides. They all seemed depressed; and Hauser had brought anold spelling-book with gnawed edges, which he held wide-open on his knee, with his great spectaclesaskew.  While I was wondering at all this, Monsieur Hamel had mounted his platform, and in the same gentleand serious voice with which he had welcomed me, he said to us:  “My children, this is the last time that I shall teach you. Orders have come from Berlin to teach nothingbut German in the schools of Alsace and Lorraine. The new teacher arrives to-morrow. This is the lastclass in French, so I beg you to be very attentive.”  Those few words overwhelmed me. Ah! the villains! that was what they had posted at the mayor’soffice.  My last class in French!  And I barely knew how to write! So I should never learn! I must stop short where I was! How angry Iwas with myself because of the time I had wasted, the lessons I had missed, running about after nests, orsliding on the Saar! My books, which only a moment before I thought so tiresome, so heavy tocarry—my grammar, my sacred history—seemed to me now like old friends, from whom I should beterribly grieved to part. And it was the same about Monsieur Hamel. The thought that he was goingaway, that I should never see him again, made me forget the punishments, the blows with the ruler.  Poor man! It was in honour of that last lesson that he had put on his fine Sunday clothes; and Iunderstood now why those old fellows from the village were sitting at the end of the room. It seemed tomean that they regretted not having come oftener to the school. It was also a way of thanking our teacherfor his forty years of faithful service, and of paying their respects to the fatherland which was vanishing.  I was at that point in my reflections, when I heard my name called. It was my turn to recite. What wouldI not have given to be able to say from beginning to end that famous rule about participles, in a loud,distinct voice, without a slip! But I got mixed up at the first words, and I stood there swaying against mybench, with a full heart, afraid to raise my head. I heard Monsieur Hamel speaking to me:  “I will not scold you, my little Frantz; you must be punished enough; that is the way it goes; every daywe say to ourselves: ‘Pshaw! I have time enough. I will learn to-morrow.’ And then you see whathappens. Ah! it has been the great misfortune of our Alsace always to postpone its lessons untilto-morrow. Now those people are entitled to say to us: ‘What! you claim to be French, and you canneither speak nor write your language!’ In all this, my poor Frantz, you are not the guiltiest one. We allhave our fair share of reproaches to address to ourselves.  “Your parents have not been careful enough to see that you were educated. They preferred to send youto work in the fields or in the factories, in order to have a few more sous. And have I nothing to reproachmyself for? Have I not often made you water my garden instead of studying? And when I wanted to gofishing for trout, have I ever hesitated to dismiss you?”  Then, passing from one thing to another, Monsieur Hamel began to talk to us about the Frenchlanguage, saying that it was the most beautiful language in the world, the most clear, the mostsubstantial; that we must always retain it among ourselves, and never forget it, because when a peoplefalls into servitude, “so long as it clings to its language, it is as if it held the key to its prison.” 1 Then hetook the grammer and read us our lesson. I was amazed to see how readily I understood. Everything thathe said seemed so easy to me, so easy. I believed, too, that I had never listened so closely, and that he, forhis part, had never been so patient with his explanations. One would have said that, before going away,the poor man desired to give us all his knowledge, to force it all into our heads at a single blow.  When the lesson was at an end, we passed to writing. For that day Monsieur Hamel had prepared someentirely new examples, on which was written in a fine, round hand: “France, Alsace, France, Alsace.”They were like little flags, waving all about the class, hanging from the rods of our desks. You shouldhave seen how hard we all worked and how silent it was! Nothing could be heard save the grinding of thepens over the paper. At one time some cock-chafers flew in; but no one paid any attention to them, noteven the little fellows who were struggling with their straight lines, with a will and conscientiousapplication, as if even the lines were French. On the roof of the schoolhouse, pigeons cooed in low tones,and I said to myself as I listened to them:  “I wonder if they are going to compel them to sing in German too!”  From time to time, when I raised my eyes from my paper. I saw Monsieur Hamel sitting motionless inhis chair and staring at the objects about him as if he wished to carry away in his glance the whole of hislittle schoolhouse. Think of it! For forty years he had been there in the same place, with his yard in frontof him and his class just as it was! But the benches and desks were polished and rubbed by use; thewalnuts in the yard had grown, and the hop-vine which he himself had planted now festooned thewindows even to the roof. What a heart-rending thing it must have been for that poor man to leave allthose things, and to hear his sister walking back and forth in the room overhead, packing their trunks! Forthey were to go away the next day—to leave the province forever.  However, he had the courage to keep the class to the end. After the writing, we had the lesson inhistory; then the little ones sang all together the ba, be, bi, bo, bu. Yonder, at the back of the room, oldHauser had put on his spectacles, and, holding his spelling-book in both hands, he spelled out the letterswith them. I could see that he too was applying himself. His voice shook with emotion, and it was sofunny to hear him, that we all longed to laugh and to cry. Ah! I shall remember that last class.  Suddenly the church clock struck twelve, then the Angelus rang. At the same moment, the bugles of thePrussians returning from drill blared under our windows. Monsieur Hamel rose, pale as death, from hischair. Never had he seemed to me so tall.  “My friends,” he said, “my friends, I—I—”  But something suffocated him. He could not finish the sentence.  Thereupon he turned to the blackboard, took a piece of chalk, and, bearing on with all his might, hewrote in the largest letters he could:  “VIVE LA FRANCE!”  Then he stood there, with his head resting against the wall, and without speaking, he motioned to uswith his hand:  “That is all; go.”, 3. The Child Spy, HIS name was Stenne, little Stenne.  He was a child of Paris, sickly and pale, who might have been ten years old, perhaps fifteen; with thoseurchins one can never tell. His mother was dead; his father, formerly in the navy, was keeper of a squarein he Temple quarter. Babies, nurse-maids, old ladies in reclining-chairs, poor mothers, all of toddlingParis that seeks shelter from vehicles in those flower-gardens bordered by paths, knew Father Stenne andadored him. They knew that beneath that rough mustache, the terror of dogs and of loiterers, layconcealed a kind, melting, almost maternal smile, and that, in order to see that smile one had only to askthe good man:  “How’s your little boy?”  Father Stenne was so fond of his boy! He was so happy in the afternoon, after school, when the littlefellow came for him and they made together the circuit of the paths, stopping at each bench to salute theoccupants and to answer their kind words.  Unfortunately with the siege everything changed. Father Stenne’s square was closed, petroleum wasstored there, and the poor man, forced to keep watch all the time, passed his life among the deserted andneglected shrubs, alone, unable to smoke, and without the company of his boy except very late at night,at home. So that you should have seen his mustache when he mentioned the Prussians. As for littleStenne, he did not complain’ very much of that new life.  A siege! It is such an amusing thing for urchins. No school! No lessons! Vacation all the time and thestreet like a fair.  The child stayed out of doors, wandering about until night. He followed the battalions of the quarterwhen they went to the fortifications, choosing by preference those which had a good band; and upon thatsubject little Stenne was well posted. He could tell you that the band of the 96th did not amount to much,but that in the 55th they had a fine one. At other times he watched the troops go through the drill; thenthere were the lines at the shopdoors.  With his basket on his arm, he stood in the long lines that formed in the dark winter mornings, withoutgas, at the doors of the butchers’ and bakers’ shops. There, with their feet in the water, people becameacquainted, talked politics, and every one asked his advice, as M. Stenne’s son. But the games ofbouchon were the most amusing thing of all, and that famous game of galoche, which the Breton militiahad brought into fashion during the siege. When little Stenne was not at the fortifications, or at thebaker’s, you were sure to find him at the game on Place du Château d’Eau. He did not play, youunderstand; it required too much money. He contented himself with watching the players, with sucheyes!  One especially, a tall youth in a blue blouse, who bet nothing less than five-franc pieces, aroused hisadmiration. When he ran you could hear the money jingling in his pockets.  One day, as he picked up a coin which had rolled to little Stenne’s feet, the tall youth said to him in anundertone:  “That makes you squint, eh? Well, I will tell you where they are to be found, if you want.”  When the game was ended he led him to a corner of the square and proposed to him to go with him tosell newspapers to the Prussians; he received thirty francs per trip. At first Stenne refused, highlyindignant; and he actually stayed away from the game for three days. Three terrible days. He did not eat,he did not sleep. At night, he saw piles of galoches at the foot of his bed, and five-franc pieces lying flat,all glistening. The temptation was too great. On the fourth day he returned to the Château d’Eau, saw thetall youth again, and allowed himself to be persuaded.  They set out one snowy morning, a canvas bag over their shoulders and newspapers hidden under theirblouses, When they reached the Flanders gate it was barely light. The tall youth took Stenne by the hand,and, approaching the sentry—an honest volunteer with a red nose and a good-natured expression—hesaid to him in the whining voice of a pauper:  “Let us pass, my kind monsieur. Our mother is sick, papa is dead, I am going out with my little brotherto pick up potatoes in the fields.”  And he wept. Stenne, covered with shame, hung his head. The sentry looked at them a moment, andcast a glance at the deserted road.  “Hurry up,” he said, stepping aside; and there they were upon the Aubervilliers Road. How the tallfellow laughed!  Confusedly, as in a dream, little Stenne saw factories transformed into barracks, abandoned barricadescovered with wet rags, long chimneys cutting the mist and rising into the sky, smokeless and broken. Atintervals, a sentry, beplumed officers looking into the distance with field-glasses, and small tentsdrenched with melted snow in front of dying fires. The tall fellow knew the roads and cut across thefields to avoid the outposts. However, they fell in with a patrol of sharp-shooters, whom they could notavoid. The sharp-shooters were in their little cabins, perched on the edge of a ditch filled with water,along the Soissons railroad. That time the tall fellow repeated his story in vain; they would not allowthem to pass. Then, while he was complaining, an old sergeant, all wrinkled and grizzled, who resembledFather Stenne, came out of the guardhouse to the road.  “Come, little brats, I wouldn’t cry!” he said to the children; “we’ll let you go to get your potatoes, butcome in and warm yourselves a little first. This little fellow looks as if he was frozen!”  Alas! It was not with cold that little Stenne was trembling—it was with fear, with shame. In theguard-house they found several soldiers crouching about a paltry fire, a genuine widow’s fire, by the heatof which they were thawing out biscuit on the points of their bayonets. They moved closer together tomake room for the children. They gave them a little coffee. While they have were drinking, an officercame to the door, called to the sergeant, spoke to him in an undertone and hurried away.  “MY boys,” said the sergeant, returning with a radiant face, “there will be something up to-night. Theyhave found out the Prussians’ countersign. I believe that this time we shall capture that infernal Bourgetagain.”  There was a explosion of cheers and laughter. They danced and sang and brandished theirsword-bayonets; and the children, taking advantage of the tumult, disappeared.  When they had passed the railway there was nothing before them but a level plain, and in the distance along, blank wall, riddled with loopholes. It was towards that wall that they bent their steps, stoopingconstantly to make it appear that they were picking up potatoes.  “Let’s go back, let’s not go on,” said little Stenne again and again.  The other shrugged his shoulders and kept on. Suddenly they heard the click of a gun being cocked.  “Lie down!” said the tall fellow, throwing himself on the ground.  When they were down, he whistled. Another whistled. Another whistle answered over the snow. Theycrawled on. In front of the wall, level with the ground, appeared a pair of yellow mustaches beneath asoiled cap. The tall youth jumped into the trench, beside the Prussian.  “This is my brother,” he said, pointing to his companion.  Little Stenne was so little, that at the sight of him the Prussian began to laugh, and he was obliged totake him in his arms to lift him up to the breach.  On the other side of the wall were great piles of earth, felled trees, black holes in the snow, and in eachhole the same dirty cap and the same yellow mustaches, laughing when they saw the children pass.  In the corner was a gardener’s house casemated with trunks of trees. The lower room was full ofsoldiers playing cards, and cooking soup over a big, blazing fire. The cabbages and pork smelled good;what a contrast to the bivouac of the sharp-shooters! Above were the officers. They could hear themplaying the piano and opening champagne. When the Parisian entered, a joyous cheer greeted them. Theyproduced their newspapers; then they were given drink and were induced to talk. All the officers had ahaughty and disdainful manner; but the tall youth amused them with his faubourgian wit, his streetArab’s vocabulary. They laughed, repeated his phrases after him, and wallowed with delight in theParisian mud which he brought them.  Little Stenne would have liked to talk too, to prove that he was not stupid, but something embarrassedhim. Opposite him, apart from the rest, was an older and graver Prussian, who was reading, or ratherseemed to be reading, for his eyes did not leave little Stenne. Affection and reproach were in his glanceas if he had at home a child of the same age as Stenne, and as if he were saying to himself:  “I would rather die than see my son engaged in such business.”  From that moment Stenne felt as it were a hand resting on his heart, which prevented it from beating.  To escape that torture, he began to drink. Soon everything about him whirled around. He heard vaguely,amid loud laughter, his comrade making fun of the National Guards, of their manner of drilling; heimitated a call to arms in the Marais, a night alarm on the ramparts. Then the tall fellow lowered hisvoice, the officers drew nearer to him, and their faces became serious. The villain was warning them ofthe attack of the sharp-shooters.  At that little Stenne sprang to his feet in a rage, thoroughly sober:  “Not that! I won’t have it!”  But the other simply laughed and kept on. Before he had finished, all the officers were standing. One ofthem pointed to the door and said to the children:  “Clear out!”  And they began to talk among themselves very rapidly, in German.  The tall youth went out as proud as a prince, jingling his money. Stenne followed him, hanging hishead; and when he passed the Prussian whose glance had embarrassed him so, he heard a sad voice say:  “Not a nice thing to do, that. Not a nice thing.”  Tears came to his eyes.  Once in the field, the children began to run and returned quickly to the city. Their bag was full ofpotatoes which the Prussians had given them. With them they passed unhindered to the trench of thesharp-shooters. There they were preparing for the night attack. Troops came up silently and massedbehind the walls. The old sergeant was there, busily engaged in posting his men, with such a happyexpression. When the children passed, he recognised them and bestowed a pleasant smile upon them.  Oh! how that smile hurt little Stenne! For a moment he was tempted to call out:  “Don’t go there; we have betrayed you.”  But the other had told him: “If you speak we shall be shot”; and fear restrained him.  At La Courneuve, they entered an abandoned house to divide the money. Truth compels me to state thatthe division was made honestly, and that little Stenne’s crime did not seem so terrible to him when heheard the coins jingling under his blouse, and thought of the games of galoche which he had in prospect.  But when he was alone, the wretched child! When the tall fellow had left him at the gate, then hispockets began to be very heavy, and the hand that grasped his heart grasped it tighter than ever. Paris didnot seem the same to him. The people who passed gazed sternly at him as if they knew whence he came.He heard the word “spy” in the rumbling of the wheels, in the beating of the drums along the canal. Atlast he reached home, and, overjoyed to find that his father was not there, he went quickly up to theirroom, to hide under his pillow that money that weighed so heavily upon him.  Never had Father Stenne been so joyous and so good-humoured as when he returned that night. Newshad been received from the provinces: affairs were looking better. As he ate, the old soldier looked at hismusket hanging on the wall, and said to the child with his hearty laugh:  “I say, my boy, how you would go at the Prussians if you were big!”  Above eight o’clock, they heard cannon.  “That is Aubervilliers. They are fighting at Bourget,” said the good man, who knew all the forts. LittleStenne turned pale, and, on the plea that he was very tired, he went to bed; but he did not sleep. Thecannon still roared. He imagined the sharp-shooters arriving in the dark to surprise the Prussians, andthemselves falling into an ambush. He remembered the sergeant who had smiled at him and he saw himstretched out on the snow, and many others with him. The price of all that blood was concealed thereunder his pillow, and it was he, the son of Monsieur Stenne, of a soldier—tears choked him. In theadjoining room he heard his father walk to the window and open it. Below on the square, the recall wassounding; and a battalion was forming to leave the city. Evidently it was a real battle. The unhappy childcloud not restrain a sob.  “What’s the matter with you?” asked Father Stenne as he entered the room.  The child could not stand it any longer; he leaped out of bed and threw himself at his father’s feet. Atthe movement that he made the silver pieces rolled on the floor.  “What is all this? Have you been stealing?” demanded the old man, trembling.  Thereupon, without pausing for breath, little Stenne told him that he had been to the Prussian quartersand of what he had done there.  As he spoke, his heart felt freer; it relieved him to accuse himself. Father Stenne listened, with a terribleface. When it was at an end, he hid face in his hands and wept.  “Father, father—” the child began.  The old man pushed him away without replying, and picked up the money.  “Is this all?” he asked.  Little Stenne motioned that it was all. The old man took down his musket and cartridge box, and said ashe put the money in his pocket:  “All right; I am going to return it to them.”  And without another word, without even turning his head, he went down and joined the troops whowere marching away in the darkness. He was never seen again., 4. The Game of Billiards, AS they have been fighting two days, and have passed the night with their knapsacks on, beneath a floodof rain, the soldiers are completely exhausted. And yet for three mortal hours they have been left waiting,with grounded arms, in the puddles of the highroads and the mud of the saturated fields.  Benumbed by fatigue, by sleepless nights, and with their uniforms drenched with rain, they crowdtogether to warm and comfort one another. There are some who sleep standing, leaning against aneighbour’s knapsack, and weariness and privations can be read distinctly upon those relaxed faces,overcome with sleep. Rain, mud, no fire, nothing to eat, a low, black sky, and the enemy in the air about.It is funereal.  What are they doing there? What is going on? The guns, with their muzzles pointed towards the wood,have the appearance of watching something. The mitrailleurs in ambush stare fixedly at the horizon.Everything seems ready for an attack. Why do they not attack? What are they waiting for?  They are awaiting orders, and headquarters sends none. And yet the headquarters are not far away. Theyare at yonder stately Louis-Treize château, whose red bricks, scoured by the rain, glisten among the treeshalf-way up the hill. Truly a princely dwelling, quite worthy to bear the banner of a marshal of France.Behind a broad moat and a stone wall which separate them from the road, smooth green lawns, lined withvases of flowers, extend to the porch. On the other side, the private side of the house, the hornbeamhedges show luminous gaps; the pond in which swans are swimming lies like a mirror, and beneath thepagodalike roof of an enormous aviary, peacocks and golden pheasants flash their wings and displaytheir plumage, uttering shrill cries amid the foliage. Although the owners have gone away, one does notfeel the abandonment, the desolation of war. The oriflamme of the leader of the army has safeguardedeven the tiniest flowers in the lawns, and it is an impressive thing to find so near the battle-field thatopulent tranquillity that is born of perfect order, of the accurate alignment of the shrubbery, of the silentdepths of the avenues.  The rain, which fills the roads yonder with such disgusting mud, and digs such deep ruts, here isnothing more than an elegant, aristocratic shower, reviving the red of the bricks and the green of thelawns, polishing the leaves of the orange-trees and the white feathers of the swans. Everything glistens,everything is peaceful. Really, but for the flag floating on the roof, but for the two soldiers on sentry-gobefore the gate, one would never suspect that it is the headquarters of an army. The horses are resting inthe stables. Here and there one sees a groom, or an orderly in undress uniform, loitering about thekitchen, or a gardener in red trousers placidly drawing his rake over the gravel in the great courtyards.  The dining-room, the windows of which look upon the porch, discloses a half-cleared table; uncorkedbottles, soiled and empty glasses on the rumpled cloth; the end of a banquet, after the guests have gone.In the adjoining room one may hear loud voices, laughter, the clicking of balls and the clinking ofglasses. The marshal is playing his game of billiards, and that is why the army is waiting for orders.When the marshal had begun his game, the heavens might fall, but nothing in the world could preventhim from finishing it.  Billiards! that is the weakness of that great warrior. He stands there, as grave as in battle, in fulluniform, his breast covered with medals, with kindled eyes, flushed cheeks, excited by feasting, grog,and the game. His aides-de-camp surround him, zealous and respectful. uttering admiring exclamations ateach of his strokes. When the marshal makes a point, they all hasten to mark it; when the marshal isthirsty, they all rush to prepare his grog. There is a constant rustling of epaulettes and plumes, a jinglingof medals; and to see all those sweet smiles, those artful, courtierlike reverences, all those new uniformsand embroidery in that lofty apartment, with its oaken wainscoting, looking upon parks and courts ofhonour, recalls the autumn days at Compiègne, and affords the eyes a little rest from the stained cloaksthat shiver yonder along the roads, forming such sombre groups in the rain.  The marshal’s opponent is a young captain of the staff, belted and curled and light-gloved, who is in thefirst rank of billiard-players and capable of beating all the marshals on earth; but he has the tact to keep arespectful distance behind his chief, and devotes his energies to the task of not winning, and at the sametime not losing too easily. He is what is called an officer with a future.  Attention, young man, let us be on our guard! The marshal has fifteen, and you ten. The point is to keepthe game in that condition to the end; then you will have done more for your promotion than if you wereoutside with the others, beneath those torrents of water which drown the horizon, soiling your nattyuniform, tarnishing the gold of your aiguillettes, awaiting orders which do not come.  It is really an interesting game. The balls roll and clash and mingle their colours. The cushions sendthem merrily back; the cloth waxes hot. Suddenly the flash of a cannon-shot passes across the sky. A dullsound rattles the windows. Everybody starts, and they look at each other anxiously. The marshal alonehas neither seen nor heard anything; leaning over the table, he is busily engaged in planning amagnificent draw-shot; draw-shots are his strong point.  But there comes another flash, then another. The cannon-shots succeed each other in hot haste. Theaides-de-camp run to the windows. Can it be that the Prussians are attacking.  “Very well, let them attack!” says the marshal, chalking his cue. “It’s your turn, captain.”  The staff quivers with admiration. Turenne asleep upon a gun-carriage was nothing compared to thismarshal, who plays billiards so tranquilly at the moment of going into action. Meanwhile the uproarredoubles. With the roar of the cannon is mingled the tearing sound of the mitrailleuses, the rattle ofmusketry. A red steam, black at the edges, rises around the lawns. The whole park is on fire. The terrifiedpeacocks and pheasants shriek in the aviary; the Arabian horses, smelling the powder, rear in the stables.The headquarters begins to be excited. Despatch after despatch. Couriers arrive at full speed. They askfor the marshal.  The marshal cannot be seen. Did I not tell you that nothing could prevent him from finishing his game?  “It is your turn, captain.”  But the captain is distraught. That is what it is to be young. Behold he loses his head, forgets his tactics,and makes two runs in succession, which almost give him the game. Thereupon the marshal becomesfurious. Surprise and indignation animate his manly face. Just at this moment a horse ridden at a hardgallop rushes into the courtyard. An aide-de-camp covered with mud forces his way past the sentries andascends the steps at one bound. “Marshal, marshal!” You should see how he is greeted. Puffing withanger and red as a rooster, the marshal appears at the window, his billiard-cue in his hand:  “What’s the matter? What’s all this? Isn’t there any sentry there?”  “But, marshal——”  “All right, in a moment; wait for my orders, in God’s name!”  And the window is violently closed.  Wait for his orders! That is just what they are doing, the poor fellows. The wind drives the rain and thegrapeshot full in their faces. Whole battalions are wiped out, while others stand useless, with their armsin readiness, utterly unable to understand their inaction. Nothing to do. They are awaiting orders.However, as one needs no orders to die, the men fall by hundreds behind the shrubs, in the moats, infront of the great silent château. Even after they have fallen, the grape tears them still, and from the openwounds the generous blood of France flows noiselessly. Above, in the billiard-room, it is getting terriblywarm too; the marshal has recovered his lead, but the little captain is defending himself like a lion.  Seventeen! eighteen! nineteen!  They hardly have time to mark the points. The roar of the battle draws nearer. The marshal has but onemore to go. Already shells are falling in the park. Suddenly one bursts over the pond. The mirror isshattered; a swan in deadly alarm swims wildly about amid an eddy of bloody feathers. That is the laststroke.  Then, a profound silence. Only the rain falling on the hedges, a confused rumbling at the foot of the hill,and, along the muddy roads, a sound like the trampling of a hurrying flock. The army is in full retreat.The marshal has won his game., 5. The Bad Zouave, THAT evening the big blacksmith, Lory of Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines, was not happy.  When the smithy fire had gone down and the sun had set, it was his custom to sit on a bench before hisdoor, tasting that grateful weariness which is the reward of heavy labor and of a hot day’s work. Beforehe sent home his apprentices, he would drink several deep glasses of cool beer with them, while hewatched the workers coming out of the factories.  But that evening the good blacksmith remained at his forge until it was time for his supper, and eventhen he went as if he regretted to leave. As his old wife looked at him, she thought.  “What can have happened to him? Can he have received bad news from the regiment and be hiding itfrom me? Perhaps the older of the boys is sick——”  But she dared not question him, and busied herself quieting three little tow-headed rascals, brown asears of parched corn, who were laughing around the table as they crunched their good salad of blackradishes and cream.  At last the blacksmith pushed back his plate in a rage and cried,  “Ah, what brutes, what curs!”  “Come, Lory, who are you talking about?” said his wife. He shouted,  “I am talking of five or six scamps who were seen this morning parading the town in their Frenchuniforms, arm in arm with the Bavarians—more of those fellows who have—how do they sayit?—‘chosen Prussian citizenship.’ And to think that every day we seeing such false Alsatians comeback! What can they have given the scoundrels to drink anyway?”  The mother tried to defend them.  “My poor husband, what do you expect? Those boys are not entirely to blame. They are sent to Algeria,so far away in Africa! They get home-sick out there, and their temptation is very strong to come back andnot be soldiers any longer.”  Lory struck the table a heavy blow with his fist.  “Be still, mother! You women-folk understand nothing at all. You live so much with children and solittle for anything else that you become exactly the size of your cubs. I tell you, those fellows areragamuffins, renegades, the worst sort of scoundrels! If bad luck ever made our own Christian capable ofsuch infamous conduct, as surely as my name is George Lory, seven years chasseur in the army ofFrance, I would run him through the body with my saber!”  Terrible to look upon, he half rose from his chair and pointed to his long chasseur’s saber, which hungunder a picture of his son in the uniform of a zouave, taken out there in Africa.  But merely to look at that honest Alsatian face,—burned almost black by the sun, the strong lightmaking the colours stand out vividly against the blank whiteness around—that was enough to quiet himsuddenly. He began to laugh.  “I am a fine fellow to be losing my head this way! As if our Christian could dream of turningPrussian—Christian, who bowled over such a lot of them in the war!”  Brought back to good humour by this idea, the good smith managed to make a cheerful meal, and setout right after it to empty a couple of glasses at the Ville de Strasbourg.  The old woman was now left alone. She had put the small blond scamps to bed; they could be heardtwittering in the next room like a nestful of birds getting ready for sleep. She picked up her work, and setto darning before the door on the garden side of the house. Once in a while she sighed, and she thought,  “Of course—there can be no doubt of it—they are scoundrels and renegades—but, what of it? Theirmothers are glad to see them again.”  And she thought of the time when her own boy had not yet gone to join the army and stood there just atthat hour of the day, getting ready to work in the garden. She looked at the well where he refilled hiswatering cans: her boy, in his blouse, with his long hair, that beautiful hair which had been cut shortwhen he entered the Zouaves.  Suddenly she trembled. The little gate at the back—the gate which led to the fields,—had been opened.The dogs had not barked, though the man who had just entered slunk along the walk like a thief, andslipped in among the beehives.  “Good-day, mother!”  His uniform all awry, there stood before her Christian, her son, anxious, shame-faced, andthick-tongued. The wretched boy had come back with the others and for the last hour had been prowlingabout the house, waiting for his father to go out. She wanted to scold him, but she had not the courage.How long it was since she had seen him, had hugged him! And then he went on to give her such goodreasons for his return!—how he had grown weary for his native countryside, for the smithy:—weary ofliving always so far away from them all, and of the discipline—much harsher of late—as well as of hiscomrades, who called him “Prussian” because of his Alsatian accent. She believed every word he said.She had only to look at him to believe him. Deep in their talk, they went into the lower room. The littleones woke up, and ran in their nightshirts and bare feet to embrace the big brother. He was urged to eat,but he was not hungry. He was only thirsty, always thirsty; and he gulped great draughts of water on topof all the beer and white wine for which he had paid that morning at the inn.  But some one was coming into the yard. It was the black-smith returning.  “Christian, here comes your father. Quick, hide until I have time to talk with him and explain.”  She pushed the boy behind the great porcelain stove and again set herself to sewing with tremblinghands. But as ill fortune would have it, the Zouave’s cap lay upon the table, and it was the first thingLory noticed as he entered. The mother’s pallor, and her agitation—he understood it all.  “Christian is here!” he cried, in a terrible voice. Taking down his saber with a mad gesture, he rushedtowards the stove where crouched the Zouave, pale, sobered, and steadying himself against the wall tokeep from falling.  The mother threw herself between them.  “Lory, Lory! Don’t kill him! He came back because I wrote that you needed him at the forge!”  She riveted her hold upon his arm, and dragged him back, sobbing. The children, in the darkness oftheir room, began to cry when they heard those voices full of anger and tears, and so thick that they didnot know them.  The smith stood still and looked at his wife.  “Oh!” he said. “So it was you who made him come back! Very well. It is time he went to bed. I shalldecide to-morrow what I must do.”  Christian woke next morning from a sleep filled with nightmares and broken by causeless terrors, tofind himself in the room he had used as a child. Already warm and well up in the sky, the sun sent itsrays across the blossoming hops and through the small leaded panes of the window. Hammers wereringing on the anvil below. His mother sat by his pillow: she had been so afraid of her husband’s angerthat she had not stirred from there all night. Nor had the father gone to bed. Till the first dawn, he hadwalked through the house weeping, sighing, opening and closing closets. He now entered his son’s room.He was very grave and dressed for a journey. He wore his high gaiters and his big hat, and carried hisheavy mountain stick with its iron ferule. He went straight to the bed.  “Come, get up!”  Dazed, the boy made as if to get his Zouave equipment.  “No, not that!” said the father, sternly.  The mother, all apprehension, said,  “But, my dear, he has no other things.”  “Give him mine. I shall not need them again.”  While the boy dressed, Lory carefully packed the uniform, with its little vest and its huge red trousers.As soon as he had made the package, he slung about his neck the tin box which contained the schedule ofcoaches.  “Now let us go down,” he said; and all three without a word descended to the smithy.  The blast roared. Everyone was at work. When Christian saw once more that great open shed of whichhe had so often thought off there in Algeria, he recalled his childhood and the long hours he had playedout there, between the heat of the road and the sparks from the forge that glittered amid the black dust.He felt a sudden flood of tenderness, a great longing to be pardoned by his father; but whenever he raisedhis eyes, he met an inexorable look.  At last the blacksmith made up his mind to speak.  “Boy,” he said, “there stands the anvil with the tools. They are all yours. And so is all this.” Heindicated the little garden which lay beyond, filled with sunshine and with bees, and framed by the sootysquare of the door.  “The hives, the vine, the house itself,—they are all yours. You sacrificed your honour for these things.The least you can do is to take care of them. Now you are master here. As for myself, I shall go away.You owe five years to France: I am going to pay them for you.”  “Lory, Lory!’ cried the poor old wife, “where are you going?”  “Father!” begged the son.  But the blacksmith was already on his way. He walked with great strides and did not turn back.  At Sidi-bel-Abbés, the dépôt of the Third Zouaves, there enlisted some days later a volunteer who gavehis age as fifty-five years., FootnotesNote 1.  “S’il tient sa langue, il tient la clé qui de ses chaines le delivre.”—Mistral.

Instead, we frame object detection as a re-gression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes andassociated class probabilities. A single neural network pre-dicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly fromfull images in one evaluation. Since the whole detectionpipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-enddirectly on detection performance., Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our baseYOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 framesper second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO,processes an astounding 155 frames per second whilestill achieving double the mAP of other real-time detec-tors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLOmakes more localization errors but is less likely to predictfalse positives on background. Finally, YOLO learns verygeneral representations of objects. It outperforms other de-tection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, when gener-alizing from natural images to other domains like artwork., 1. IntroductionHumans glance at an image and instantly know what ob-jects are in the image, where they are, and how they inter-act. The human visual system is fast and accurate, allow-ing us to perform complex tasks like driving with little con-scious thought. Fast, accurate algorithms for object detec-tion would allow computers to drive cars without special-ized sensors, enable assistive devices to convey real-timescene information to human users, and unlock the potentialfor general purpose, responsive robotic systems., Current detection systems repurpose classifiers to per-form detection. To detect an object, these systems take aclassifier for that object and evaluate it at various locationsand scales in a test image. Systems like deformable partsmodels (DPM) use a sliding window approach where theclassifier is run at evenly spaced locations over the entireimage [10]., More recent approaches like R-CNN use region proposal, 1. Resize image., 2. Run convolutional network., 3. Non-max suppression., Dog: 0.30, Person: 0.64, Horse: 0.28, Figure 1: The YOLO Detection System. Processing imageswith YOLO is simple and straightforward. Our system (1) resizesthe input image to 448× 448, (2) runs a single convolutional net-work on the image, and (3) thresholds the resulting detections bythe model’s confidence.methods to first generate potential bounding boxes in an im-age and then run a classifier on these proposed boxes. Afterclassification, post-processing is used to refine the bound-ing boxes, eliminate duplicate detections, and rescore theboxes based on other objects in the scene [13]. These com-plex pipelines are slow and hard to optimize because eachindividual component must be trained separately., We reframe object detection as a single regression prob-lem, straight from image pixels to bounding box coordi-nates and class probabilities. Using our system, you onlylook once (YOLO) at an image to predict what objects arepresent and where they are., YOLO is refreshingly simple: see Figure 1. A sin-gle convolutional network simultaneously predicts multi-ple bounding boxes and class probabilities for those boxes.YOLO trains on full images and directly optimizes detec-tion performance. This unified model has several benefitsover traditional methods of object detection., First, YOLO is extremely fast. Since we frame detectionas a regression problem we don’t need a complex pipeline.We simply run our neural network on a new image at testtime to predict detections. Our base network runs at 45frames per second with no batch processing on a Titan XGPU and a fast version runs at more than 150 fps. Thismeans we can process streaming video in real-time withless than 25 milliseconds of latency. Furthermore, YOLOachieves more than twice the mean average precision ofother real-time systems. For a demo of our system runningin real-time on a webcam please see our project webpage:http://pjreddie.com/yolo/., Second, YOLO reasons globally about the image when, 1arXiv:1, 506., 0264, 0v5  [cs.CV]  9 May 201, 6http://pjreddie.com/yolo/http://pjreddie.com/yolo/making predictions. Unlike sliding window and regionproposal-based techniques, YOLO sees the entire imageduring training and test time so it implicitly encodes contex-tual information about classes as well as their appearance.Fast R-CNN, a top detection method [14], mistakes back-ground patches in an image for objects because it can’t seethe larger context. YOLO makes less than half the numberof background errors compared to Fast R-CNN., Third, YOLO learns generalizable representations of ob-jects. When trained on natural images and tested on art-work, YOLO outperforms top detection methods like DPMand R-CNN by a wide margin. Since YOLO is highly gen-eralizable it is less likely to break down when applied tonew domains or unexpected inputs., YOLO still lags behind state-of-the-art detection systemsin accuracy. While it can quickly identify objects in im-ages it struggles to precisely localize some objects, espe-cially small ones. We examine these tradeoffs further in ourexperiments., All of our training and testing code is open source. Avariety of pretrained models are also available to download., 2. Unified Detection, We unify the separate components of object detectioninto a single neural network. Our network uses featuresfrom the entire image to predict each bounding box. It alsopredicts all bounding boxes across all classes for an im-age simultaneously. This means our network reasons glob-ally about the full image and all the objects in the image.The YOLO design enables end-to-end training and real-time speeds while maintaining high average precision., Our system divides the input image into an S × S grid.If the center of an object falls into a grid cell, that grid cellis responsible for detecting that object., Each grid cell predictsB bounding boxes and confidencescores for those boxes. These confidence scores reflect howconfident the model is that the box contains an object andalso how accurate it thinks the box is that it predicts. For-mally we define confidence as Pr(Object) ∗ IOUtruthpred . If noobject exists in that cell, the confidence scores should bezero. Otherwise we want the confidence score to equal theintersection over union (IOU) between the predicted boxand the ground truth., Each bounding box consists of 5 predictions: x, y, w, h,and confidence. The (x, y) coordinates represent the centerof the box relative to the bounds of the grid cell. The widthand height are predicted relative to the whole image. Finallythe confidence prediction represents the IOU between thepredicted box and any ground truth box., Each grid cell also predicts C conditional class proba-bilities, Pr(Classi|Object). These probabilities are condi-tioned on the grid cell containing an object. We only predictone set of class probabilities per grid cell, regardless of thenumber of boxes B., At test time we multiply the conditional class probabili-ties and the individual box confidence predictions,, Pr(Classi|Object) ∗ Pr(Object) ∗ IOUtruthpred = Pr(Classi) ∗ IOUtruthpred (1)which gives us class-specific confidence scores for eachbox. These scores encode both the probability of that classappearing in the box and how well the predicted box fits theobject., S × S grid on input, Bounding boxes + confidence, Class probability map, Final detections, Figure 2: The Model. Our system models detection as a regres-sion problem. It divides the image into an S×S grid and for eachgrid cell predicts B bounding boxes, confidence for those boxes,and C class probabilities. These predictions are encoded as anS × S × (B ∗ 5 + C) tensor., For evaluating YOLO on PASCAL VOC, we use S = 7,B = 2. PASCAL VOC has 20 labelled classes so C = 20.Our final prediction is a 7× 7× 30 tensor., 2.1. Network Design, We implement this model as a convolutional neural net-work and evaluate it on the PASCAL VOC detection dataset[9]. The initial convolutional layers of the network extractfeatures from the image while the fully connected layerspredict the output probabilities and coordinates., Our network architecture is inspired by the GoogLeNetmodel for image classification [34]. Our network has 24convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers.Instead of the inception modules used by GoogLeNet, wesimply use 1× 1 reduction layers followed by 3× 3 convo-lutional layers, similar to Lin et al [22]. The full network isshown in Figure 3., We also train a fast version of YOLO designed to pushthe boundaries of fast object detection. Fast YOLO uses aneural network with fewer convolutional layers (9 insteadof 24) and fewer filters in those layers. Other than the sizeof the network, all training and testing parameters are thesame between YOLO and Fast YOLO., 448, 448, 3, 7, 7, Conv.

Our detection network has 24 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers. Alternating 1× 1convolutional layers reduce the features space from preceding layers. We pretrain the convolutional layers on the ImageNet classificationtask at half the resolution (224× 224 input image) and then double the resolution for detection., The final output of our network is the 7× 7× 30 tensorof predictions., 2.2. Training, We pretrain our convolutional layers on the ImageNet1000-class competition dataset [30]. For pretraining we usethe first 20 convolutional layers from Figure 3 followed by aaverage-pooling layer and a fully connected layer. We trainthis network for approximately a week and achieve a singlecrop top-5 accuracy of 88% on the ImageNet 2012 valida-tion set, comparable to the GoogLeNet models in Caffe’sModel Zoo [24]. We use the Darknet framework for alltraining and inference [26]., We then convert the model to perform detection. Ren etal. show that adding both convolutional and connected lay-ers to pretrained networks can improve performance [29].Following their example, we add four convolutional lay-ers and two fully connected layers with randomly initializedweights. Detection often requires fine-grained visual infor-mation so we increase the input resolution of the networkfrom 224× 224 to 448× 448., Our final layer predicts both class probabilities andbounding box coordinates. We normalize the bounding boxwidth and height by the image width and height so that theyfall between 0 and 1. We parametrize the bounding box xand y coordinates to be offsets of a particular grid cell loca-tion so they are also bounded between 0 and 1., We use a linear activation function for the final layer andall other layers use the following leaky rectified linear acti-vation:φ(x) ={x, if x &gt; 00.1x, otherwise(2), We optimize for sum-squared error in the output of ourmodel. We use sum-squared error because it is easy to op-timize, however it does not perfectly align with our goal ofmaximizing average precision. It weights localization er-ror equally with classification error which may not be ideal.Also, in every image many grid cells do not contain anyobject. This pushes the “confidence” scores of those cellstowards zero, often overpowering the gradient from cellsthat do contain objects. This can lead to model instability,causing training to diverge early on., To remedy this, we increase the loss from bounding boxcoordinate predictions and decrease the loss from confi-dence predictions for boxes that don’t contain objects. Weuse two parameters, λcoord and λnoobj to accomplish this. Weset λcoord = 5 and λnoobj = .5., Sum-squared error also equally weights errors in largeboxes and small boxes. Our error metric should reflect thatsmall deviations in large boxes matter less than in smallboxes. To partially address this we predict the square rootof the bounding box width and height instead of the widthand height directly., YOLO predicts multiple bounding boxes per grid cell.At training time we only want one bounding box predictorto be responsible for each object. We assign one predictorto be “responsible” for predicting an object based on whichprediction has the highest current IOU with the groundtruth. This leads to specialization between the bounding boxpredictors. Each predictor gets better at predicting certainsizes, aspect ratios, or classes of object, improving overallrecall., ...]</td>\n",

The Bad Zouave, Biographical Note, ALPHONSE DAUDET was born at Nîmes in the south of France on May 13, 1840. His father was anunsuccessful silk manufacturer, and his boyhood was far from happy. After a period of schooling atLyons, he became at sixteen usher in a school, but before the end of the following year he abandoned aprofession in which he found only misery. Going up to Paris he joined his elder brother, Ernest, who wasthen trying to get a foothold in journalism. At eighteen he published a volume of poems, “LesAmoureuses,” wrote for the “Figaro,” and began experimenting with playwriting. He attracted theattention of the Duc de Morny, who made him one of his secretaries and in various ways helped him to astart in life.  His first notable success came in 1866 with his “Lettres de mon Moulin,” a series of sketches andstories of great charm and delicacy, and this was followed up by a longer work, “Le petit chose,” apathetic fiction based upon his own unhappy youth. In 1872 he produced the first of his three volumes onthe amazing “Tartarin of Tarascon,” probably the most vital of all his creations. In “Fromont jeune etRisler aîné” he created another great character, Delobelle, the broken-down actor, and he took captive thereading world by his combination of humor and pathos, and the vividness of his portraits of types. Pathoswas again the chief characteristic of “Jack,” in which the life of a neglected boy at a school which recallsthe establishment of Mr. Squeers is not the only parallel between Daudet and Dickens.  Daudet was now a successful writer of established reputation, and through the seventies and eighties hewrote a succession of novels of a considerable variety of theme. Thus he dealt with the Paris ofdethroned monarchs in “Les Rois en exil”; with new millionaires in “Le Nabab”; with the talkative typeof his native South in “Numa Roumestan,” satirizing the statesman Gambetta; with the demimonde in“Sapho”; while in “L’Immortel” he drew a scathing picture of the French Academy, which neverhonored itself by electing him to membership. “Tartarin” reappeared in all his buoyancy in “Tartarin surles Alpes,” and, less successfully as a colonist in “Port-Tarascon.” Some volumes of reminiscences, aconsiderable number of short stories, some delightful tales for children, and a few plays complete the listof his more important writings. He died at Paris on December 17, 1897.  Daudet was especially distinguished for his style. He wrote with a great impression of ease, yet heobtained an effect of great brilliance and felicity. He belonged to the realistic school, and though heachieved a very living sense of actuality he escaped the cynicism and brutality that marked the work ofsome of his colleagues.  None of his work is more perfect of its kind than his short stories, and the collection called “Contes dulundi” from which the following examples are taken exhibit his power of restrained pathos at its height.The horrors of the Franco-Prussian War have been more terribly pictured on some larger canvases, butno one has etched with more delicacy and sensitiveness the small private tragedies of that great disaster.“The Siege of Berlin,” “The Last Class,” and “The Bad Zouave” are not only classics of the art of theshort story; they contain the essence of French patriotism., W. A. N., Criticisms and Interpretations, I. By Henry James, THE CHARM of Daudet’s talent comes from its being charged to an extraordinary degree with histemperament, his feelings, his instincts, his natural qualities. This, of course, is a charm in a style onlywhen nature has been generous. To Alphonse Daudet she has been exceptionally so; she has placed in hishand an instrument of many chords. A delicate nervous organisation, active and indefatigable in spite ofits delicacy, and familiar with emotion of almost every kind, equally acquainted with pleasure and withpain; a light, quick, joyous, yet reflective, imagination, a faculty of seeing images, making images, atevery turn, of conceiving everything in the visible form, in the plastic spirit; an extraordinary sensibilityto all the impressions of life and a faculty of language which is in perfect harmony with his wonderfulfineness of perception—these are some of the qualities of which he is the happy possessor, and whichmake his equipment for the work he has undertaken exceedingly rich.—From “Partial Portraits” (1888)., Criticisms and Interpretations, II. By George Pellissier, DAUDET works in a sort of fever. Even before beginning to write his books, he has related, acted, andalmost “lived” them. This habit responds to a necessity of his nature, and this he also constitutes hisprocess of composition. The original sketch is only an improvisation, but with the second version beginswhat he calls the painful part of his labor. He first abandons himself to his fancy, giving free rein to histroubadour instincts. The subject urges him on and outstrips him; his hand glides rapidly over the paperwithout writing all the words, or even pausing to punctuate, in the effort to follow the fever of his toilingbrain by hastily stenographing ideas and sentiments. Only with that “trembling of the fingers,” with hima sign of inspiration, does he take up his pen. He at once launches into the full current of the action. Ashis figures are already “on foot in his mind,” he loses no time in introducing them in full activity. Thegreater part of his novels consists in a series of pictures or episodes which pass in file beneath our eyes.There are no preludes either at the outset or in passing from one chapter to another; he explains thesituation by a word, leaving the reader to imagine such events as are not adapted to an entirely actualmise en scène. He renders only what moves his heart and sets his nerves in vibration—what is dramatic,picturesque, and animated in human affairs.—From “The Literary Movement in France in the NineteenthCentury” (1893)., 1. The Siege of Berlin, WE were going up Avenue des Champs-Elysées with Dr. V——, asking the shell-riddled walls, and thesidewalks torn up by grape-shot, for the story of the siege of Paris, when, just before we reached theRond-point de l’Etoile, the doctor stopped and, pointing to one of the great corner houses so proudlygrouped about the Arc de Triomphe, said to me:  “Do you see those four closed windows up there on that balcony? In the early days of August, thatterrible August of last year, so heavily laden with storms and disasters, I was called there to see a case ofapoplexy. It was the apartment of Colonel Jouve, a cuirassier of the First Empire, an old enthusiast on thesubject of glory and patriotism, who had come to live on the Champs-Élysées, in an apartment with abalcony, at the outbreak of the war. Guess why? In order to witness the triumphant return of our troops.Poor old fellow! The news of Wissembourg reached him just as he was leaving the table. When he readthe name of Napoleon at the foot of that bulletin of defeat, he fell like a log.  “I found the former cuirassier stretched out at full length on the carpet, his face covered with blood, andas lifeless as if he had received a blow on the head from a poleaxe. He must have been very tall when hewas standing; lying there, he looked enormous. Handsome features, magnificent teeth, a fleece of curlywhite hair, eighty years with the appearance of sixty. Beside him was his granddaughter, on her kneesand bathed in tears. She looked like him. One who saw them side by side might have taken them for twobeautiful Greek medallions, struck from the same die, one of which was old and earth-coloured, a littleroughened on the edges, the other resplendent and clean-cut, in all the brilliancy and smoothness of afresh impression.  “The child’s grief touched me. Daughter and granddaughter of soldiers, her father was on MacMahon’sstaff, and the image of that tall old man stretched out before her evoked in her mind another image noless terrible. I comforted her as best I could, but in reality I had little hope. We had to do with a case ofcomplete paralysis on one side, and at eighty years of age few people recover from it. For three days thepatient lay in the same state of inanition and stupor. Then the news of Reichshofen reached Paris. Youremember in what a strange way it came. Up to the evening, we all believed in a great victory, twentythousand Prussians killed and the Prince Royal a prisoner. I know not by what miracle, what magneticcurrent, an echo of that national rejoicing sought out our poor deaf-mute in the depths of his paralysis;but the fact is that on that evening, when I approached his bed, I did not find the same man there. His eyewas almost clear, his tongue less heavy. He had the strength to smile at me, and he stammered twice:  “‘Vic-to-ry!’  “And as I gave him details of the grand exploit of MacMahon, I saw that his features relaxed and hisface lighted up.  “When I left the room, the girl was waiting for me at the door, pale as death. She was sobbing.  “‘But he is saved!’ I said, taking her hands.  “The unhappy child hardly had the courage to reply. The true report of Reichshofen had been placarded;MacMahon in retreat, the whole army crushed. We gazed at each other in consternation. She was indespair, thinking of her father. I trembled, thinking of the old man. He certainly could not stand this freshshock. And yet what were we to do? Leave him his joy, and the illusions which had revived him? But inthat case we must lie.  “‘Very well, I will lie!’ said the heroic girl, quickly wiping away her tears; and with radiant face sheentered her grandfather’s chamber.  “It was a hard task that she had undertaken. The first few days she had no great difficulty. The goodman’s brain was feeble, and he allowed himself to be deceived like a child. But with returning health hisideas became clearer. We had to keep him posted concerning the movement of the armies, to draw upmilitary bulletins for him. Really, it was pitiful to see that lovely child leaning night and day over hermap of Germany, pinning little flags upon it, and struggling to lay out a glorious campaign: Bazainebesieging Berlin, Froissart in Bavaria, MacMahon on the Baltic. For all this she asked my advice, and Iassisted her as well as I could; but it was the grandfather who was especially useful to us in thatimaginary invasion. He had conquered Germany so many times under the First Empire! He knew all thestrokes beforehand: ‘Now this is where they will go. Now this is what they will do’; and his anticipationswere always realised, which did not fail to make him very proud.  “Unlucky it was of no avail for us to take cities and win battles; we never went quickly enough for him.That old man was insatiable! Every day, when I arrived, I learned of some new military exploit.  “‘Doctor, we have taken Mayence,’ the girl would say to me, coming to meet me with a heart-brokensmile, and I would hear through the door a joyous voice shouting to me:  “‘They are getting on! They are getting on! In a week we shall be in Berlin!’  “At that moment the Prussians were only a week’s march from Paris. We asked ourselves at first if itwould be better to take him into the provinces; but as soon as we were outside the city, the state of thecountry would have told him everything, and I considered him still too weak, too much benumbed by hisgreat shock, to let him know the truth. So we decided to remain.  “The first day of the investment of Paris, I went up to their rooms, I remember, deeply moved, with thatagony at the heart which the closed gates, the fighting under the walls, and our suburbs turned intofrontiers, gave us all. I found the good man seated on his bed, proud and jubilant.  “‘Well,’ he said, ‘so the siege has begun!’  “I gazed at him in blank amazement.  “‘What, colonel! you know?’  “His granddaughter turned towards me:  “‘Why, yes, doctor, that’s the great news. The siege of Berlin has begun.’  “As she said this, she plied her needle with such a sedate and placid air! How could he have suspectedanything? He could not hear the guns of the forts. He could not see our unfortunate Paris, all in confusionand dreadful to behold. What he saw from his bed was a section of the Arc de Triomphe, and in his room,about him, a collection of bric-a-brac of the First Empire, well adapted to maintain his illusion. Portraitsof marshals, engravings of battles, the King of Rome in a baby’s dress, tall consoles adorned with coppertrophies, laden with imperial relics, medals, bronzes, a miniature of St. Helena, under a globe, picturesrepresenting the same lady all becurled, in a ball-dress of yellow, with leg-of-mutton sleeves and brighteyes;—and all these things: consoles, King of Rome, marshals, yellow ladies, with the high-necked,short-waisted dresses, the bestarched stiffness, which was the charm of 1806. Gallant colonel! It was thatatmosphere of victories and conquests, even more than anything we could say to him, that made himbelieve so innocently in the siege of Berlin.  “From that day our military operations were much simplified. To take Berlin was only a matter ofpatience. From time to time, when the old man was too much bored, we would read him a letter from hisson—an imaginary letter, of course, for nothing was allowed to enter Paris, and since Sedan,MacMahon’s aide-de-camp had been sent to a German fortress. You can imagine the despair of that poorchild, without news from her father, knowing that he was a prisoner, in need of everything, perhaps sick,and she obliged to represent him as writing joyful letters, a little short, perhaps, but such as a soldier onthe field might be expected to write, always marching forward through a conquered country. Sometimesher strength gave way; then they were without news for weeks. But the old man became anxious, couldnot sleep. Thereupon a letter from Germany would speedily arrive, which she would bring to his bedsideand read joyously, forcing back her tears. The colonel would listen religiously, smile with a knowing air,approve, criticise, and explain to us the passages that seemed a little confused. But where he wasespecially grand was in the replies that he sent to his son. ‘Never forget that you are a Frenchman,’ hewould say to him. ‘Be generous to those poor people. Don’t make the invasion too hard for them.’ Andthere were recommendations without end, admirable preachments upon respect for the proprieties, thecourtesy which should be shown to the ladies, a complete code of military honour for the use ofconquerors. He interspersed also some general considerations upon politics, the conditions of peace to beimposed upon the vanquished. Thereupon I must say that he was not exacting.  “‘A war indemnity, and nothing more. What is the use of taking their provinces? Is it possible to turnGermany into France?’  “He dictated this in a firm voice; and one was conscious of such candour in his words, of such a noble,patriotic faith, that it was impossible not to be moved while listening to him.  “Meanwhile the siege went on—not the siege of Berlin, alas! It was the time of intense cold, of thebombardment, of epidemics and of famine. But, thanks to our care, to our efforts, to the unwearyingaffection which multiplied itself about him, the old man’s serenity was not disturbed for an instant. Tothe very end I was able to obtain white bread and fresh meat for him. There was none for anybody buthim, to be sure; and you can imagine nothing more touching than those breakfasts of the grandfather, soinnocently selfish—the old man seated on his bed, fresh and smiling, with a napkin at his chin, and hisgranddaughter beside him, a little pale because of privations, guiding his hand, helping him to drink, andto eat all those forbidden good things. Then, enlivened by the repast, in the comfort of his warm room,the winter wind whistling outside and the snow eddying about his windows, the ex-cuirassier wouldrecall his campaigns in the north and would describe to us for the hundredth time that terrible retreatfrom Russia, when they had nothing to eat but frozen biscuit and horseflesh.  “‘Do you understand that, my love? We had horseflesh!’  “I rather think that she did understand it. For two months she had had nothing else. From that day,however, as the period of convalescence drew near, our task about the patient became more difficult.That numbness of all his senses, of all his members, which had served us so well hitherto, began todisappear. Two or three times, the terrible volleys from Porte Maillot had made him jump, with his earspricked up like a hunting-dog; we were obliged to invent a final victory of Bazaine under the walls ofBerlin, and guns fired in his honour at the Invalides. Another day when his bed had been moved to thewindow—it was, I believe, the Thursday of Buzenval—he saw large numbers of National Guardscollected on Avenue de la Grande Armée.  “‘What are all those troops?’ asked the good man; and we heard him mutter between his teeth:  “‘Poorly set up! Poorly set up!’  “That was all; but we understood that we must take great precautions thenceforth. Unluckily we did nottake enough.  “One evening when I arrived, the girl came to me in great trouble.  “‘They are to march into the city to-morrow,’ she said.  “Was the grandfather’s door open? In truth, on thinking it over afterwards, I remembered that his facewore an extraordinary expression that night. It is probable that he had overheard us. But we were talkingof the Prussians; and the good man was thinking of the French, of that triumphal entry which he had beenawaiting so long—MacMahon marching down the avenue amid flowers and flourishes of trumpets, hisson beside him, and he, the old colonel, on his balcony, in full uniform as at Lutzen, saluting the tornflags and the eagles blackened by powder.  “Poor Father Jouve! He had imagined doubtless that we intended to prevent him from witnessing thatparade of our troops, in order to avoid too great excitement. So he was very careful not to mention it toany one; but the next day, at the very hour when the Prussian battalions entered hesitatingly upon thelong road which leads from Porte Maillot to the Tuileries, the window up there opened softly, and thecolonel appeared on the balcony, with his helmet, his long sword, all the glorious old array of one ofMilhaud’s cuirassiers. I wonder still what effort of the will, what sudden outburst of life had placed himthus upon his feet and in his harness. This much is sure, that he was there, standing behind the rail,amazed to find the broad avenues so silent, the blinds of the houses closed, Paris as gloomy as a hugelazaretto, flags everywhere, but such strange flags, white with little crosses, and no one to go to meet oursoldiers.  “For a moment he might have thought that he was mistaken.  “But no! Yonder, behind the Arc de Triomphe, there was a confused rumbling, a black line approachingin the rising sunlight. Then, little by little, the points of the helmets gleamed, the little drums of Jenabegan to beat, and beneath the Arc de Triomphe, while the heavy tramp of the regiments and the clashingof the sabres beat time, Schubert’s Triumphal March burst forth!  “Thereupon in the deathlike silence of the square, a cry rang out, a terrible cry: ‘To arms! To arms! ThePrussians!’ and the four uhlans of the vanguard saw up yonder, on the balcony, a tall old man wave hisarms, stagger, and fall. That time, Colonel Jouve was really dead.”, 2. The Last Class—The Story of a Little Alsatian, I WAS very late for school that morning, and I was terribly afraid of being scolded, especially asMonsieur Hamel had told us that he should examine us on participles, and I did not know the first thingabout them. For a moment I thought of staying away from school and wandering about the fields. It wassuch a warm, lovely day. I could hear the blackbirds whistling on the edge of the wood, and in theRippert field, behind the sawmill, the Prussians going through their drill. All that was much moretempting to me than the rules concerning participles; but I had the strength to resist, and I ran as fast as Icould to school.  As I passed the mayor’s office, I saw that there were people gathered about the little board on whichnotices were posted. For two years all our bad news had come from that board—battles lost,conscriptions, orders from headquarters; and I thought without stopping:  “What can it be now?”  Then, as I ran across the square, Wachter the blacksmith, who stood there with his apprentice, readingthe placard, called out to me:  “Don’t hurry so, my boy; you’ll get to your school soon enough!”  I thought that he was making fun of me, and I ran into Monsieur Hamel’s little yard all out of breath.  Usually, at the beginning of school, there was a great uproar which could be heard in the street, desksopening and closing, lessons repeated aloud in unison, with our ears stuffed in order to learn quicker, andthe teacher’s stout ruler beating on the desk:  “A little more quiet!”  I counted on all this noise to reach my bench unnoticed; but as it happened, that day everything wasquiet, like a Sunday morning. Through the open window I saw my comrades already in their places, andMonsieur Hamel walking back and forth with the terrible iron ruler under his arm. I had no open the doorand enter, in the midst of that perfect silence. You can imagine whether I blushed and whether I wasafraid!  But no! Monsieur Hamel looked at me with no sign of anger and said very gently:  “Go at once to your seat, my little Frantz; we were going to begin without you.”  I stepped over the bench and sat down at once at my desk. Not until then, when I had partly recoveredfrom my fright, did I notice that our teacher had on his handsome blue coat, his plaited ruff, and the blacksilk embroidered breeches, which he wore only on days of inspection or of distribution of prizes.Moreover, there was something extraordinary, something solemn about the whole class. But whatsurprised me most was to see at the back of the room, on the benches which were usually empty, somepeople from the village sitting, as silent as we were: old Hauser with his three-cornered hat, theex-mayor, the ex-postman, and others besides. They all seemed depressed; and Hauser had brought anold spelling-book with gnawed edges, which he held wide-open on his knee, with his great spectaclesaskew.  While I was wondering at all this, Monsieur Hamel had mounted his platform, and in the same gentleand serious voice with which he had welcomed me, he said to us:  “My children, this is the last time that I shall teach you. Orders have come from Berlin to teach nothingbut German in the schools of Alsace and Lorraine. The new teacher arrives to-morrow. This is the lastclass in French, so I beg you to be very attentive.”  Those few words overwhelmed me. Ah! the villains! that was what they had posted at the mayor’soffice.  My last class in French!  And I barely knew how to write! So I should never learn! I must stop short where I was! How angry Iwas with myself because of the time I had wasted, the lessons I had missed, running about after nests, orsliding on the Saar! My books, which only a moment before I thought so tiresome, so heavy tocarry—my grammar, my sacred history—seemed to me now like old friends, from whom I should beterribly grieved to part. And it was the same about Monsieur Hamel. The thought that he was goingaway, that I should never see him again, made me forget the punishments, the blows with the ruler.  Poor man! It was in honour of that last lesson that he had put on his fine Sunday clothes; and Iunderstood now why those old fellows from the village were sitting at the end of the room. It seemed tomean that they regretted not having come oftener to the school. It was also a way of thanking our teacherfor his forty years of faithful service, and of paying their respects to the fatherland which was vanishing.  I was at that point in my reflections, when I heard my name called. It was my turn to recite. What wouldI not have given to be able to say from beginning to end that famous rule about participles, in a loud,distinct voice, without a slip! But I got mixed up at the first words, and I stood there swaying against mybench, with a full heart, afraid to raise my head. I heard Monsieur Hamel speaking to me:  “I will not scold you, my little Frantz; you must be punished enough; that is the way it goes; every daywe say to ourselves: ‘Pshaw! I have time enough. I will learn to-morrow.’ And then you see whathappens. Ah! it has been the great misfortune of our Alsace always to postpone its lessons untilto-morrow. Now those people are entitled to say to us: ‘What! you claim to be French, and you canneither speak nor write your language!’ In all this, my poor Frantz, you are not the guiltiest one. We allhave our fair share of reproaches to address to ourselves.  “Your parents have not been careful enough to see that you were educated. They preferred to send youto work in the fields or in the factories, in order to have a few more sous. And have I nothing to reproachmyself for? Have I not often made you water my garden instead of studying? And when I wanted to gofishing for trout, have I ever hesitated to dismiss you?”  Then, passing from one thing to another, Monsieur Hamel began to talk to us about the Frenchlanguage, saying that it was the most beautiful language in the world, the most clear, the mostsubstantial; that we must always retain it among ourselves, and never forget it, because when a peoplefalls into servitude, “so long as it clings to its language, it is as if it held the key to its prison.” 1 Then hetook the grammer and read us our lesson. I was amazed to see how readily I understood. Everything thathe said seemed so easy to me, so easy. I believed, too, that I had never listened so closely, and that he, forhis part, had never been so patient with his explanations. One would have said that, before going away,the poor man desired to give us all his knowledge, to force it all into our heads at a single blow.  When the lesson was at an end, we passed to writing. For that day Monsieur Hamel had prepared someentirely new examples, on which was written in a fine, round hand: “France, Alsace, France, Alsace.”They were like little flags, waving all about the class, hanging from the rods of our desks. You shouldhave seen how hard we all worked and how silent it was! Nothing could be heard save the grinding of thepens over the paper. At one time some cock-chafers flew in; but no one paid any attention to them, noteven the little fellows who were struggling with their straight lines, with a will and conscientiousapplication, as if even the lines were French. On the roof of the schoolhouse, pigeons cooed in low tones,and I said to myself as I listened to them:  “I wonder if they are going to compel them to sing in German too!”  From time to time, when I raised my eyes from my paper. I saw Monsieur Hamel sitting motionless inhis chair and staring at the objects about him as if he wished to carry away in his glance the whole of hislittle schoolhouse. Think of it! For forty years he had been there in the same place, with his yard in frontof him and his class just as it was! But the benches and desks were polished and rubbed by use; thewalnuts in the yard had grown, and the hop-vine which he himself had planted now festooned thewindows even to the roof. What a heart-rending thing it must have been for that poor man to leave allthose things, and to hear his sister walking back and forth in the room overhead, packing their trunks! Forthey were to go away the next day—to leave the province forever.  However, he had the courage to keep the class to the end. After the writing, we had the lesson inhistory; then the little ones sang all together the ba, be, bi, bo, bu. Yonder, at the back of the room, oldHauser had put on his spectacles, and, holding his spelling-book in both hands, he spelled out the letterswith them. I could see that he too was applying himself. His voice shook with emotion, and it was sofunny to hear him, that we all longed to laugh and to cry. Ah! I shall remember that last class.  Suddenly the church clock struck twelve, then the Angelus rang. At the same moment, the bugles of thePrussians returning from drill blared under our windows. Monsieur Hamel rose, pale as death, from hischair. Never had he seemed to me so tall.  “My friends,” he said, “my friends, I—I—”  But something suffocated him. He could not finish the sentence.  Thereupon he turned to the blackboard, took a piece of chalk, and, bearing on with all his might, hewrote in the largest letters he could:  “VIVE LA FRANCE!”  Then he stood there, with his head resting against the wall, and without speaking, he motioned to uswith his hand:  “That is all; go.”, 3. The Child Spy, HIS name was Stenne, little Stenne.  He was a child of Paris, sickly and pale, who might have been ten years old, perhaps fifteen; with thoseurchins one can never tell. His mother was dead; his father, formerly in the navy, was keeper of a squarein he Temple quarter. Babies, nurse-maids, old ladies in reclining-chairs, poor mothers, all of toddlingParis that seeks shelter from vehicles in those flower-gardens bordered by paths, knew Father Stenne andadored him. They knew that beneath that rough mustache, the terror of dogs and of loiterers, layconcealed a kind, melting, almost maternal smile, and that, in order to see that smile one had only to askthe good man:  “How’s your little boy?”  Father Stenne was so fond of his boy! He was so happy in the afternoon, after school, when the littlefellow came for him and they made together the circuit of the paths, stopping at each bench to salute theoccupants and to answer their kind words.  Unfortunately with the siege everything changed. Father Stenne’s square was closed, petroleum wasstored there, and the poor man, forced to keep watch all the time, passed his life among the deserted andneglected shrubs, alone, unable to smoke, and without the company of his boy except very late at night,at home. So that you should have seen his mustache when he mentioned the Prussians. As for littleStenne, he did not complain’ very much of that new life.  A siege! It is such an amusing thing for urchins. No school! No lessons! Vacation all the time and thestreet like a fair.  The child stayed out of doors, wandering about until night. He followed the battalions of the quarterwhen they went to the fortifications, choosing by preference those which had a good band; and upon thatsubject little Stenne was well posted. He could tell you that the band of the 96th did not amount to much,but that in the 55th they had a fine one. At other times he watched the troops go through the drill; thenthere were the lines at the shopdoors.  With his basket on his arm, he stood in the long lines that formed in the dark winter mornings, withoutgas, at the doors of the butchers’ and bakers’ shops. There, with their feet in the water, people becameacquainted, talked politics, and every one asked his advice, as M. Stenne’s son. But the games ofbouchon were the most amusing thing of all, and that famous game of galoche, which the Breton militiahad brought into fashion during the siege. When little Stenne was not at the fortifications, or at thebaker’s, you were sure to find him at the game on Place du Château d’Eau. He did not play, youunderstand; it required too much money. He contented himself with watching the players, with sucheyes!  One especially, a tall youth in a blue blouse, who bet nothing less than five-franc pieces, aroused hisadmiration. When he ran you could hear the money jingling in his pockets.  One day, as he picked up a coin which had rolled to little Stenne’s feet, the tall youth said to him in anundertone:  “That makes you squint, eh? Well, I will tell you where they are to be found, if you want.”  When the game was ended he led him to a corner of the square and proposed to him to go with him tosell newspapers to the Prussians; he received thirty francs per trip. At first Stenne refused, highlyindignant; and he actually stayed away from the game for three days. Three terrible days. He did not eat,he did not sleep. At night, he saw piles of galoches at the foot of his bed, and five-franc pieces lying flat,all glistening. The temptation was too great. On the fourth day he returned to the Château d’Eau, saw thetall youth again, and allowed himself to be persuaded.  They set out one snowy morning, a canvas bag over their shoulders and newspapers hidden under theirblouses, When they reached the Flanders gate it was barely light. The tall youth took Stenne by the hand,and, approaching the sentry—an honest volunteer with a red nose and a good-natured expression—hesaid to him in the whining voice of a pauper:  “Let us pass, my kind monsieur. Our mother is sick, papa is dead, I am going out with my little brotherto pick up potatoes in the fields.”  And he wept. Stenne, covered with shame, hung his head. The sentry looked at them a moment, andcast a glance at the deserted road.  “Hurry up,” he said, stepping aside; and there they were upon the Aubervilliers Road. How the tallfellow laughed!  Confusedly, as in a dream, little Stenne saw factories transformed into barracks, abandoned barricadescovered with wet rags, long chimneys cutting the mist and rising into the sky, smokeless and broken. Atintervals, a sentry, beplumed officers looking into the distance with field-glasses, and small tentsdrenched with melted snow in front of dying fires. The tall fellow knew the roads and cut across thefields to avoid the outposts. However, they fell in with a patrol of sharp-shooters, whom they could notavoid. The sharp-shooters were in their little cabins, perched on the edge of a ditch filled with water,along the Soissons railroad. That time the tall fellow repeated his story in vain; they would not allowthem to pass. Then, while he was complaining, an old sergeant, all wrinkled and grizzled, who resembledFather Stenne, came out of the guardhouse to the road.  “Come, little brats, I wouldn’t cry!” he said to the children; “we’ll let you go to get your potatoes, butcome in and warm yourselves a little first. This little fellow looks as if he was frozen!”  Alas! It was not with cold that little Stenne was trembling—it was with fear, with shame. In theguard-house they found several soldiers crouching about a paltry fire, a genuine widow’s fire, by the heatof which they were thawing out biscuit on the points of their bayonets. They moved closer together tomake room for the children. They gave them a little coffee. While they have were drinking, an officercame to the door, called to the sergeant, spoke to him in an undertone and hurried away.  “MY boys,” said the sergeant, returning with a radiant face, “there will be something up to-night. Theyhave found out the Prussians’ countersign. I believe that this time we shall capture that infernal Bourgetagain.”  There was a explosion of cheers and laughter. They danced and sang and brandished theirsword-bayonets; and the children, taking advantage of the tumult, disappeared.  When they had passed the railway there was nothing before them but a level plain, and in the distance along, blank wall, riddled with loopholes. It was towards that wall that they bent their steps, stoopingconstantly to make it appear that they were picking up potatoes.  “Let’s go back, let’s not go on,” said little Stenne again and again.  The other shrugged his shoulders and kept on. Suddenly they heard the click of a gun being cocked.  “Lie down!” said the tall fellow, throwing himself on the ground.  When they were down, he whistled. Another whistled. Another whistle answered over the snow. Theycrawled on. In front of the wall, level with the ground, appeared a pair of yellow mustaches beneath asoiled cap. The tall youth jumped into the trench, beside the Prussian.  “This is my brother,” he said, pointing to his companion.  Little Stenne was so little, that at the sight of him the Prussian began to laugh, and he was obliged totake him in his arms to lift him up to the breach.  On the other side of the wall were great piles of earth, felled trees, black holes in the snow, and in eachhole the same dirty cap and the same yellow mustaches, laughing when they saw the children pass.  In the corner was a gardener’s house casemated with trunks of trees. The lower room was full ofsoldiers playing cards, and cooking soup over a big, blazing fire. The cabbages and pork smelled good;what a contrast to the bivouac of the sharp-shooters! Above were the officers. They could hear themplaying the piano and opening champagne. When the Parisian entered, a joyous cheer greeted them. Theyproduced their newspapers; then they were given drink and were induced to talk. All the officers had ahaughty and disdainful manner; but the tall youth amused them with his faubourgian wit, his streetArab’s vocabulary. They laughed, repeated his phrases after him, and wallowed with delight in theParisian mud which he brought them.  Little Stenne would have liked to talk too, to prove that he was not stupid, but something embarrassedhim. Opposite him, apart from the rest, was an older and graver Prussian, who was reading, or ratherseemed to be reading, for his eyes did not leave little Stenne. Affection and reproach were in his glanceas if he had at home a child of the same age as Stenne, and as if he were saying to himself:  “I would rather die than see my son engaged in such business.”  From that moment Stenne felt as it were a hand resting on his heart, which prevented it from beating.  To escape that torture, he began to drink. Soon everything about him whirled around. He heard vaguely,amid loud laughter, his comrade making fun of the National Guards, of their manner of drilling; heimitated a call to arms in the Marais, a night alarm on the ramparts. Then the tall fellow lowered hisvoice, the officers drew nearer to him, and their faces became serious. The villain was warning them ofthe attack of the sharp-shooters.  At that little Stenne sprang to his feet in a rage, thoroughly sober:  “Not that! I won’t have it!”  But the other simply laughed and kept on. Before he had finished, all the officers were standing. One ofthem pointed to the door and said to the children:  “Clear out!”  And they began to talk among themselves very rapidly, in German.  The tall youth went out as proud as a prince, jingling his money. Stenne followed him, hanging hishead; and when he passed the Prussian whose glance had embarrassed him so, he heard a sad voice say:  “Not a nice thing to do, that. Not a nice thing.”  Tears came to his eyes.  Once in the field, the children began to run and returned quickly to the city. Their bag was full ofpotatoes which the Prussians had given them. With them they passed unhindered to the trench of thesharp-shooters. There they were preparing for the night attack. Troops came up silently and massedbehind the walls. The old sergeant was there, busily engaged in posting his men, with such a happyexpression. When the children passed, he recognised them and bestowed a pleasant smile upon them.  Oh! how that smile hurt little Stenne! For a moment he was tempted to call out:  “Don’t go there; we have betrayed you.”  But the other had told him: “If you speak we shall be shot”; and fear restrained him.  At La Courneuve, they entered an abandoned house to divide the money. Truth compels me to state thatthe division was made honestly, and that little Stenne’s crime did not seem so terrible to him when heheard the coins jingling under his blouse, and thought of the games of galoche which he had in prospect.  But when he was alone, the wretched child! When the tall fellow had left him at the gate, then hispockets began to be very heavy, and the hand that grasped his heart grasped it tighter than ever. Paris didnot seem the same to him. The people who passed gazed sternly at him as if they knew whence he came.He heard the word “spy” in the rumbling of the wheels, in the beating of the drums along the canal. Atlast he reached home, and, overjoyed to find that his father was not there, he went quickly up to theirroom, to hide under his pillow that money that weighed so heavily upon him.  Never had Father Stenne been so joyous and so good-humoured as when he returned that night. Newshad been received from the provinces: affairs were looking better. As he ate, the old soldier looked at hismusket hanging on the wall, and said to the child with his hearty laugh:  “I say, my boy, how you would go at the Prussians if you were big!”  Above eight o’clock, they heard cannon.  “That is Aubervilliers. They are fighting at Bourget,” said the good man, who knew all the forts. LittleStenne turned pale, and, on the plea that he was very tired, he went to bed; but he did not sleep. Thecannon still roared. He imagined the sharp-shooters arriving in the dark to surprise the Prussians, andthemselves falling into an ambush. He remembered the sergeant who had smiled at him and he saw himstretched out on the snow, and many others with him. The price of all that blood was concealed thereunder his pillow, and it was he, the son of Monsieur Stenne, of a soldier—tears choked him. In theadjoining room he heard his father walk to the window and open it. Below on the square, the recall wassounding; and a battalion was forming to leave the city. Evidently it was a real battle. The unhappy childcloud not restrain a sob.  “What’s the matter with you?” asked Father Stenne as he entered the room.  The child could not stand it any longer; he leaped out of bed and threw himself at his father’s feet. Atthe movement that he made the silver pieces rolled on the floor.  “What is all this? Have you been stealing?” demanded the old man, trembling.  Thereupon, without pausing for breath, little Stenne told him that he had been to the Prussian quartersand of what he had done there.  As he spoke, his heart felt freer; it relieved him to accuse himself. Father Stenne listened, with a terribleface. When it was at an end, he hid face in his hands and wept.  “Father, father—” the child began.  The old man pushed him away without replying, and picked up the money.  “Is this all?” he asked.  Little Stenne motioned that it was all. The old man took down his musket and cartridge box, and said ashe put the money in his pocket:  “All right; I am going to return it to them.”  And without another word, without even turning his head, he went down and joined the troops whowere marching away in the darkness. He was never seen again., 4. The Game of Billiards, AS they have been fighting two days, and have passed the night with their knapsacks on, beneath a floodof rain, the soldiers are completely exhausted. And yet for three mortal hours they have been left waiting,with grounded arms, in the puddles of the highroads and the mud of the saturated fields.  Benumbed by fatigue, by sleepless nights, and with their uniforms drenched with rain, they crowdtogether to warm and comfort one another. There are some who sleep standing, leaning against aneighbour’s knapsack, and weariness and privations can be read distinctly upon those relaxed faces,overcome with sleep. Rain, mud, no fire, nothing to eat, a low, black sky, and the enemy in the air about.It is funereal.  What are they doing there? What is going on? The guns, with their muzzles pointed towards the wood,have the appearance of watching something. The mitrailleurs in ambush stare fixedly at the horizon.Everything seems ready for an attack. Why do they not attack? What are they waiting for?  They are awaiting orders, and headquarters sends none. And yet the headquarters are not far away. Theyare at yonder stately Louis-Treize château, whose red bricks, scoured by the rain, glisten among the treeshalf-way up the hill. Truly a princely dwelling, quite worthy to bear the banner of a marshal of France.Behind a broad moat and a stone wall which separate them from the road, smooth green lawns, lined withvases of flowers, extend to the porch. On the other side, the private side of the house, the hornbeamhedges show luminous gaps; the pond in which swans are swimming lies like a mirror, and beneath thepagodalike roof of an enormous aviary, peacocks and golden pheasants flash their wings and displaytheir plumage, uttering shrill cries amid the foliage. Although the owners have gone away, one does notfeel the abandonment, the desolation of war. The oriflamme of the leader of the army has safeguardedeven the tiniest flowers in the lawns, and it is an impressive thing to find so near the battle-field thatopulent tranquillity that is born of perfect order, of the accurate alignment of the shrubbery, of the silentdepths of the avenues.  The rain, which fills the roads yonder with such disgusting mud, and digs such deep ruts, here isnothing more than an elegant, aristocratic shower, reviving the red of the bricks and the green of thelawns, polishing the leaves of the orange-trees and the white feathers of the swans. Everything glistens,everything is peaceful. Really, but for the flag floating on the roof, but for the two soldiers on sentry-gobefore the gate, one would never suspect that it is the headquarters of an army. The horses are resting inthe stables. Here and there one sees a groom, or an orderly in undress uniform, loitering about thekitchen, or a gardener in red trousers placidly drawing his rake over the gravel in the great courtyards.  The dining-room, the windows of which look upon the porch, discloses a half-cleared table; uncorkedbottles, soiled and empty glasses on the rumpled cloth; the end of a banquet, after the guests have gone.In the adjoining room one may hear loud voices, laughter, the clicking of balls and the clinking ofglasses. The marshal is playing his game of billiards, and that is why the army is waiting for orders.When the marshal had begun his game, the heavens might fall, but nothing in the world could preventhim from finishing it.  Billiards! that is the weakness of that great warrior. He stands there, as grave as in battle, in fulluniform, his breast covered with medals, with kindled eyes, flushed cheeks, excited by feasting, grog,and the game. His aides-de-camp surround him, zealous and respectful. uttering admiring exclamations ateach of his strokes. When the marshal makes a point, they all hasten to mark it; when the marshal isthirsty, they all rush to prepare his grog. There is a constant rustling of epaulettes and plumes, a jinglingof medals; and to see all those sweet smiles, those artful, courtierlike reverences, all those new uniformsand embroidery in that lofty apartment, with its oaken wainscoting, looking upon parks and courts ofhonour, recalls the autumn days at Compiègne, and affords the eyes a little rest from the stained cloaksthat shiver yonder along the roads, forming such sombre groups in the rain.  The marshal’s opponent is a young captain of the staff, belted and curled and light-gloved, who is in thefirst rank of billiard-players and capable of beating all the marshals on earth; but he has the tact to keep arespectful distance behind his chief, and devotes his energies to the task of not winning, and at the sametime not losing too easily. He is what is called an officer with a future.  Attention, young man, let us be on our guard! The marshal has fifteen, and you ten. The point is to keepthe game in that condition to the end; then you will have done more for your promotion than if you wereoutside with the others, beneath those torrents of water which drown the horizon, soiling your nattyuniform, tarnishing the gold of your aiguillettes, awaiting orders which do not come.  It is really an interesting game. The balls roll and clash and mingle their colours. The cushions sendthem merrily back; the cloth waxes hot. Suddenly the flash of a cannon-shot passes across the sky. A dullsound rattles the windows. Everybody starts, and they look at each other anxiously. The marshal alonehas neither seen nor heard anything; leaning over the table, he is busily engaged in planning amagnificent draw-shot; draw-shots are his strong point.  But there comes another flash, then another. The cannon-shots succeed each other in hot haste. Theaides-de-camp run to the windows. Can it be that the Prussians are attacking.  “Very well, let them attack!” says the marshal, chalking his cue. “It’s your turn, captain.”  The staff quivers with admiration. Turenne asleep upon a gun-carriage was nothing compared to thismarshal, who plays billiards so tranquilly at the moment of going into action. Meanwhile the uproarredoubles. With the roar of the cannon is mingled the tearing sound of the mitrailleuses, the rattle ofmusketry. A red steam, black at the edges, rises around the lawns. The whole park is on fire. The terrifiedpeacocks and pheasants shriek in the aviary; the Arabian horses, smelling the powder, rear in the stables.The headquarters begins to be excited. Despatch after despatch. Couriers arrive at full speed. They askfor the marshal.  The marshal cannot be seen. Did I not tell you that nothing could prevent him from finishing his game?  “It is your turn, captain.”  But the captain is distraught. That is what it is to be young. Behold he loses his head, forgets his tactics,and makes two runs in succession, which almost give him the game. Thereupon the marshal becomesfurious. Surprise and indignation animate his manly face. Just at this moment a horse ridden at a hardgallop rushes into the courtyard. An aide-de-camp covered with mud forces his way past the sentries andascends the steps at one bound. “Marshal, marshal!” You should see how he is greeted. Puffing withanger and red as a rooster, the marshal appears at the window, his billiard-cue in his hand:  “What’s the matter? What’s all this? Isn’t there any sentry there?”  “But, marshal——”  “All right, in a moment; wait for my orders, in God’s name!”  And the window is violently closed.  Wait for his orders! That is just what they are doing, the poor fellows. The wind drives the rain and thegrapeshot full in their faces. Whole battalions are wiped out, while others stand useless, with their armsin readiness, utterly unable to understand their inaction. Nothing to do. They are awaiting orders.However, as one needs no orders to die, the men fall by hundreds behind the shrubs, in the moats, infront of the great silent château. Even after they have fallen, the grape tears them still, and from the openwounds the generous blood of France flows noiselessly. Above, in the billiard-room, it is getting terriblywarm too; the marshal has recovered his lead, but the little captain is defending himself like a lion.  Seventeen! eighteen! nineteen!  They hardly have time to mark the points. The roar of the battle draws nearer. The marshal has but onemore to go. Already shells are falling in the park. Suddenly one bursts over the pond. The mirror isshattered; a swan in deadly alarm swims wildly about amid an eddy of bloody feathers. That is the laststroke.  Then, a profound silence. Only the rain falling on the hedges, a confused rumbling at the foot of the hill,and, along the muddy roads, a sound like the trampling of a hurrying flock. The army is in full retreat.The marshal has won his game., 5. The Bad Zouave, THAT evening the big blacksmith, Lory of Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines, was not happy.  When the smithy fire had gone down and the sun had set, it was his custom to sit on a bench before hisdoor, tasting that grateful weariness which is the reward of heavy labor and of a hot day’s work. Beforehe sent home his apprentices, he would drink several deep glasses of cool beer with them, while hewatched the workers coming out of the factories.  But that evening the good blacksmith remained at his forge until it was time for his supper, and eventhen he went as if he regretted to leave. As his old wife looked at him, she thought.  “What can have happened to him? Can he have received bad news from the regiment and be hiding itfrom me? Perhaps the older of the boys is sick——”  But she dared not question him, and busied herself quieting three little tow-headed rascals, brown asears of parched corn, who were laughing around the table as they crunched their good salad of blackradishes and cream.  At last the blacksmith pushed back his plate in a rage and cried,  “Ah, what brutes, what curs!”  “Come, Lory, who are you talking about?” said his wife. He shouted,  “I am talking of five or six scamps who were seen this morning parading the town in their Frenchuniforms, arm in arm with the Bavarians—more of those fellows who have—how do they sayit?—‘chosen Prussian citizenship.’ And to think that every day we seeing such false Alsatians comeback! What can they have given the scoundrels to drink anyway?”  The mother tried to defend them.  “My poor husband, what do you expect? Those boys are not entirely to blame. They are sent to Algeria,so far away in Africa! They get home-sick out there, and their temptation is very strong to come back andnot be soldiers any longer.”  Lory struck the table a heavy blow with his fist.  “Be still, mother! You women-folk understand nothing at all. You live so much with children and solittle for anything else that you become exactly the size of your cubs. I tell you, those fellows areragamuffins, renegades, the worst sort of scoundrels! If bad luck ever made our own Christian capable ofsuch infamous conduct, as surely as my name is George Lory, seven years chasseur in the army ofFrance, I would run him through the body with my saber!”  Terrible to look upon, he half rose from his chair and pointed to his long chasseur’s saber, which hungunder a picture of his son in the uniform of a zouave, taken out there in Africa.  But merely to look at that honest Alsatian face,—burned almost black by the sun, the strong lightmaking the colours stand out vividly against the blank whiteness around—that was enough to quiet himsuddenly. He began to laugh.  “I am a fine fellow to be losing my head this way! As if our Christian could dream of turningPrussian—Christian, who bowled over such a lot of them in the war!”  Brought back to good humour by this idea, the good smith managed to make a cheerful meal, and setout right after it to empty a couple of glasses at the Ville de Strasbourg.  The old woman was now left alone. She had put the small blond scamps to bed; they could be heardtwittering in the next room like a nestful of birds getting ready for sleep. She picked up her work, and setto darning before the door on the garden side of the house. Once in a while she sighed, and she thought,  “Of course—there can be no doubt of it—they are scoundrels and renegades—but, what of it? Theirmothers are glad to see them again.”  And she thought of the time when her own boy had not yet gone to join the army and stood there just atthat hour of the day, getting ready to work in the garden. She looked at the well where he refilled hiswatering cans: her boy, in his blouse, with his long hair, that beautiful hair which had been cut shortwhen he entered the Zouaves.  Suddenly she trembled. The little gate at the back—the gate which led to the fields,—had been opened.The dogs had not barked, though the man who had just entered slunk along the walk like a thief, andslipped in among the beehives.  “Good-day, mother!”  His uniform all awry, there stood before her Christian, her son, anxious, shame-faced, andthick-tongued. The wretched boy had come back with the others and for the last hour had been prowlingabout the house, waiting for his father to go out. She wanted to scold him, but she had not the courage.How long it was since she had seen him, had hugged him! And then he went on to give her such goodreasons for his return!—how he had grown weary for his native countryside, for the smithy:—weary ofliving always so far away from them all, and of the discipline—much harsher of late—as well as of hiscomrades, who called him “Prussian” because of his Alsatian accent. She believed every word he said.She had only to look at him to believe him. Deep in their talk, they went into the lower room. The littleones woke up, and ran in their nightshirts and bare feet to embrace the big brother. He was urged to eat,but he was not hungry. He was only thirsty, always thirsty; and he gulped great draughts of water on topof all the beer and white wine for which he had paid that morning at the inn.  But some one was coming into the yard. It was the black-smith returning.  “Christian, here comes your father. Quick, hide until I have time to talk with him and explain.”  She pushed the boy behind the great porcelain stove and again set herself to sewing with tremblinghands. But as ill fortune would have it, the Zouave’s cap lay upon the table, and it was the first thingLory noticed as he entered. The mother’s pallor, and her agitation—he understood it all.  “Christian is here!” he cried, in a terrible voice. Taking down his saber with a mad gesture, he rushedtowards the stove where crouched the Zouave, pale, sobered, and steadying himself against the wall tokeep from falling.  The mother threw herself between them.  “Lory, Lory! Don’t kill him! He came back because I wrote that you needed him at the forge!”  She riveted her hold upon his arm, and dragged him back, sobbing. The children, in the darkness oftheir room, began to cry when they heard those voices full of anger and tears, and so thick that they didnot know them.  The smith stood still and looked at his wife.  “Oh!” he said. “So it was you who made him come back! Very well. It is time he went to bed. I shalldecide to-morrow what I must do.”  Christian woke next morning from a sleep filled with nightmares and broken by causeless terrors, tofind himself in the room he had used as a child. Already warm and well up in the sky, the sun sent itsrays across the blossoming hops and through the small leaded panes of the window. Hammers wereringing on the anvil below. His mother sat by his pillow: she had been so afraid of her husband’s angerthat she had not stirred from there all night. Nor had the father gone to bed. Till the first dawn, he hadwalked through the house weeping, sighing, opening and closing closets. He now entered his son’s room.He was very grave and dressed for a journey. He wore his high gaiters and his big hat, and carried hisheavy mountain stick with its iron ferule. He went straight to the bed.  “Come, get up!”  Dazed, the boy made as if to get his Zouave equipment.  “No, not that!” said the father, sternly.  The mother, all apprehension, said,  “But, my dear, he has no other things.”  “Give him mine. I shall not need them again.”  While the boy dressed, Lory carefully packed the uniform, with its little vest and its huge red trousers.As soon as he had made the package, he slung about his neck the tin box which contained the schedule ofcoaches.  “Now let us go down,” he said; and all three without a word descended to the smithy.  The blast roared. Everyone was at work. When Christian saw once more that great open shed of whichhe had so often thought off there in Algeria, he recalled his childhood and the long hours he had playedout there, between the heat of the road and the sparks from the forge that glittered amid the black dust.He felt a sudden flood of tenderness, a great longing to be pardoned by his father; but whenever he raisedhis eyes, he met an inexorable look.  At last the blacksmith made up his mind to speak.  “Boy,” he said, “there stands the anvil with the tools. They are all yours. And so is all this.” Heindicated the little garden which lay beyond, filled with sunshine and with bees, and framed by the sootysquare of the door.  “The hives, the vine, the house itself,—they are all yours. You sacrificed your honour for these things.The least you can do is to take care of them. Now you are master here. As for myself, I shall go away.You owe five years to France: I am going to pay them for you.”  “Lory, Lory!’ cried the poor old wife, “where are you going?”  “Father!” begged the son.  But the blacksmith was already on his way. He walked with great strides and did not turn back.  At Sidi-bel-Abbés, the dépôt of the Third Zouaves, there enlisted some days later a volunteer who gavehis age as fifty-five years., FootnotesNote 1.  “S’il tient sa langue, il tient la clé qui de ses chaines le delivre.”—Mistral.

              "1  YOLO orignial paper              [You Only Look Once:Unified, Real-Time Object Detection, Joseph Redmon∗, Santosh Divvala∗†, Ross Girshick¶, Ali Farhadi∗†, University of Washington∗, Allen Institute for AI†, Facebook AI Research¶http://pjreddie.com/yolo/, AbstractWe present YOLO, a new approach to object detection., Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to per-form detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a re-gression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes andassociated class probabilities. A single neural network pre-dicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly fromfull images in one evaluation. Since the whole detectionpipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-enddirectly on detection performance., Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our baseYOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 framesper second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO,processes an astounding 155 frames per second whilestill achieving double the mAP of other real-time detec-tors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLOmakes more localization errors but is less likely to predictfalse positives on background. Finally, YOLO learns verygeneral representations of objects. It outperforms other de-tection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, when gener-alizing from natural images to other domains like artwork., 1. IntroductionHumans glance at an image and instantly know what ob-jects are in the image, where they are, and how they inter-act. The human visual system is fast and accurate, allow-ing us to perform complex tasks like driving with little con-scious thought. Fast, accurate algorithms for object detec-tion would allow computers to drive cars without special-ized sensors, enable assistive devices to convey real-timescene information to human users, and unlock the potentialfor general purpose, responsive robotic systems., Current detection systems repurpose classifiers to per-form detection. To detect an object, these systems take aclassifier for that object and evaluate it at various locationsand scales in a test image. Systems like deformable partsmodels (DPM) use a sliding window approach where theclassifier is run at evenly spaced locations over the entireimage [10]., More recent approaches like R-CNN use region proposal, 1. Resize image., 2. Run convolutional network., 3. Non-max suppression., Dog: 0.30, Person: 0.64, Horse: 0.28, Figure 1: The YOLO Detection System. Processing imageswith YOLO is simple and straightforward. Our system (1) resizesthe input image to 448× 448, (2) runs a single convolutional net-work on the image, and (3) thresholds the resulting detections bythe model’s confidence.methods to first generate potential bounding boxes in an im-age and then run a classifier on these proposed boxes. Afterclassification, post-processing is used to refine the bound-ing boxes, eliminate duplicate detections, and rescore theboxes based on other objects in the scene [13]. These com-plex pipelines are slow and hard to optimize because eachindividual component must be trained separately., We reframe object detection as a single regression prob-lem, straight from image pixels to bounding box coordi-nates and class probabilities. Using our system, you onlylook once (YOLO) at an image to predict what objects arepresent and where they are., YOLO is refreshingly simple: see Figure 1. A sin-gle convolutional network simultaneously predicts multi-ple bounding boxes and class probabilities for those boxes.YOLO trains on full images and directly optimizes detec-tion performance. This unified model has several benefitsover traditional methods of object detection., First, YOLO is extremely fast. Since we frame detectionas a regression problem we don’t need a complex pipeline.We simply run our neural network on a new image at testtime to predict detections. Our base network runs at 45frames per second with no batch processing on a Titan XGPU and a fast version runs at more than 150 fps. Thismeans we can process streaming video in real-time withless than 25 milliseconds of latency. Furthermore, YOLOachieves more than twice the mean average precision ofother real-time systems. For a demo of our system runningin real-time on a webcam please see our project webpage:http://pjreddie.com/yolo/., Second, YOLO reasons globally about the image when, 1arXiv:1, 506., 0264, 0v5  [cs.CV]  9 May 201, 6http://pjreddie.com/yolo/http://pjreddie.com/yolo/making predictions. Unlike sliding window and regionproposal-based techniques, YOLO sees the entire imageduring training and test time so it implicitly encodes contex-tual information about classes as well as their appearance.Fast R-CNN, a top detection method [14], mistakes back-ground patches in an image for objects because it can’t seethe larger context. YOLO makes less than half the numberof background errors compared to Fast R-CNN., Third, YOLO learns generalizable representations of ob-jects. When trained on natural images and tested on art-work, YOLO outperforms top detection methods like DPMand R-CNN by a wide margin. Since YOLO is highly gen-eralizable it is less likely to break down when applied tonew domains or unexpected inputs., YOLO still lags behind state-of-the-art detection systemsin accuracy. While it can quickly identify objects in im-ages it struggles to precisely localize some objects, espe-cially small ones. We examine these tradeoffs further in ourexperiments., All of our training and testing code is open source. Avariety of pretrained models are also available to download., 2. Unified Detection, We unify the separate components of object detectioninto a single neural network. Our network uses featuresfrom the entire image to predict each bounding box. It alsopredicts all bounding boxes across all classes for an im-age simultaneously. This means our network reasons glob-ally about the full image and all the objects in the image.The YOLO design enables end-to-end training and real-time speeds while maintaining high average precision., Our system divides the input image into an S × S grid.If the center of an object falls into a grid cell, that grid cellis responsible for detecting that object., Each grid cell predictsB bounding boxes and confidencescores for those boxes. These confidence scores reflect howconfident the model is that the box contains an object andalso how accurate it thinks the box is that it predicts. For-mally we define confidence as Pr(Object) ∗ IOUtruthpred . If noobject exists in that cell, the confidence scores should bezero. Otherwise we want the confidence score to equal theintersection over union (IOU) between the predicted boxand the ground truth., Each bounding box consists of 5 predictions: x, y, w, h,and confidence. The (x, y) coordinates represent the centerof the box relative to the bounds of the grid cell. The widthand height are predicted relative to the whole image. Finallythe confidence prediction represents the IOU between thepredicted box and any ground truth box., Each grid cell also predicts C conditional class proba-bilities, Pr(Classi|Object). These probabilities are condi-tioned on the grid cell containing an object. We only predictone set of class probabilities per grid cell, regardless of thenumber of boxes B., At test time we multiply the conditional class probabili-ties and the individual box confidence predictions,, Pr(Classi|Object) ∗ Pr(Object) ∗ IOUtruthpred = Pr(Classi) ∗ IOUtruthpred (1)which gives us class-specific confidence scores for eachbox. These scores encode both the probability of that classappearing in the box and how well the predicted box fits theobject., S × S grid on input, Bounding boxes + confidence, Class probability map, Final detections, Figure 2: The Model. Our system models detection as a regres-sion problem. It divides the image into an S×S grid and for eachgrid cell predicts B bounding boxes, confidence for those boxes,and C class probabilities. These predictions are encoded as anS × S × (B ∗ 5 + C) tensor., For evaluating YOLO on PASCAL VOC, we use S = 7,B = 2. PASCAL VOC has 20 labelled classes so C = 20.Our final prediction is a 7× 7× 30 tensor., 2.1. Network Design, We implement this model as a convolutional neural net-work and evaluate it on the PASCAL VOC detection dataset[9]. The initial convolutional layers of the network extractfeatures from the image while the fully connected layerspredict the output probabilities and coordinates., Our network architecture is inspired by the GoogLeNetmodel for image classification [34]. Our network has 24convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers.Instead of the inception modules used by GoogLeNet, wesimply use 1× 1 reduction layers followed by 3× 3 convo-lutional layers, similar to Lin et al [22]. The full network isshown in Figure 3., We also train a fast version of YOLO designed to pushthe boundaries of fast object detection. Fast YOLO uses aneural network with fewer convolutional layers (9 insteadof 24) and fewer filters in those layers. Other than the sizeof the network, all training and testing parameters are thesame between YOLO and Fast YOLO., 448, 448, 3, 7, 7, Conv.

Our detection network has 24 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers. Alternating 1× 1convolutional layers reduce the features space from preceding layers. We pretrain the convolutional layers on the ImageNet classificationtask at half the resolution (224× 224 input image) and then double the resolution for detection., The final output of our network is the 7× 7× 30 tensorof predictions., 2.2. Training, We pretrain our convolutional layers on the ImageNet1000-class competition dataset [30]. For pretraining we usethe first 20 convolutional layers from Figure 3 followed by aaverage-pooling layer and a fully connected layer. We trainthis network for approximately a week and achieve a singlecrop top-5 accuracy of 88% on the ImageNet 2012 valida-tion set, comparable to the GoogLeNet models in Caffe’sModel Zoo [24]. We use the Darknet framework for alltraining and inference [26]., We then convert the model to perform detection. Ren etal. show that adding both convolutional and connected lay-ers to pretrained networks can improve performance [29].Following their example, we add four convolutional lay-ers and two fully connected layers with randomly initializedweights. Detection often requires fine-grained visual infor-mation so we increase the input resolution of the networkfrom 224× 224 to 448× 448., Our final layer predicts both class probabilities andbounding box coordinates. We normalize the bounding boxwidth and height by the image width and height so that theyfall between 0 and 1. We parametrize the bounding box xand y coordinates to be offsets of a particular grid cell loca-tion so they are also bounded between 0 and 1., We use a linear activation function for the final layer andall other layers use the following leaky rectified linear acti-vation:φ(x) ={x, if x > 00.1x, otherwise(2), We optimize for sum-squared error in the output of ourmodel. We use sum-squared error because it is easy to op-timize, however it does not perfectly align with our goal ofmaximizing average precision. It weights localization er-ror equally with classification error which may not be ideal.Also, in every image many grid cells do not contain anyobject. This pushes the “confidence” scores of those cellstowards zero, often overpowering the gradient from cellsthat do contain objects. This can lead to model instability,causing training to diverge early on., To remedy this, we increase the loss from bounding boxcoordinate predictions and decrease the loss from confi-dence predictions for boxes that don’t contain objects. Weuse two parameters, λcoord and λnoobj to accomplish this. Weset λcoord = 5 and λnoobj = .5., Sum-squared error also equally weights errors in largeboxes and small boxes. Our error metric should reflect thatsmall deviations in large boxes matter less than in smallboxes. To partially address this we predict the square rootof the bounding box width and height instead of the widthand height directly., YOLO predicts multiple bounding boxes per grid cell.At training time we only want one bounding box predictorto be responsible for each object. We assign one predictorto be “responsible” for predicting an object based on whichprediction has the highest current IOU with the groundtruth. This leads to specialization between the bounding boxpredictors. Each predictor gets better at predicting certainsizes, aspect ratios, or classes of object, improving overallrecall., ...]

            " WE were going up Avenue des Champs-Elysées with Dr. V——, asking the shell-riddled walls, and thesidewalks torn up by grape-shot, for the story of the siege of Paris, when, just before we reached theRond-point de l’Etoile, the doctor stopped and, pointing to one of the great corner houses so proudlygrouped about the Arc de Triomphe, said to me:  “Do you see those four closed windows up there on that balcony? In the early days of August, thatterrible August of last year, so heavily laden with storms and disasters, I was called there to see a case ofapoplexy. It was the apartment of Colonel Jouve, a cuirassier of the First Empire, an old enthusiast on thesubject of glory and patriotism, who had come to live on the Champs-Élysées, in an apartment with abalcony, at the outbreak of the war. Guess why? In order to witness the triumphant return of our troops.Poor old fellow! The news of Wissembourg reached him just as he was leaving the table. When he readthe name of Napoleon at the foot of that bulletin of defeat, he fell like a log.  “I found the former cuirassier stretched out at full length on the carpet, his face covered with blood, andas lifeless as if he had received a blow on the head from a poleaxe. He must have been very tall when hewas standing; lying there, he looked enormous. Handsome features, magnificent teeth, a fleece of curlywhite hair, eighty years with the appearance of sixty. Beside him was his granddaughter, on her kneesand bathed in tears. She looked like him. One who saw them side by side might have taken them for twobeautiful Greek medallions, struck from the same die, one of which was old and earth-coloured, a littleroughened on the edges, the other resplendent and clean-cut, in all the brilliancy and smoothness of afresh impression.  “The child’s grief touched me. Daughter and granddaughter of soldiers, her father was on MacMahon’sstaff, and the image of that tall old man stretched out before her evoked in her mind another image noless terrible. I comforted her as best I could, but in reality I had little hope. We had to do with a case ofcomplete paralysis on one side, and at eighty years of age few people recover from it. For three days thepatient lay in the same state of inanition and stupor. Then the news of Reichshofen reached Paris. Youremember in what a strange way it came. Up to the evening, we all believed in a great victory, twentythousand Prussians killed and the Prince Royal a prisoner. I know not by what miracle, what magneticcurrent, an echo of that national rejoicing sought out our poor deaf-mute in the depths of his paralysis;but the fact is that on that evening, when I approached his bed, I did not find the same man there. His eyewas almost clear, his tongue less heavy. He had the strength to smile at me, and he stammered twice:  “‘Vic-to-ry!’  “And as I gave him details of the grand exploit of MacMahon, I saw that his features relaxed and hisface lighted up.  “When I left the room, the girl was waiting for me at the door, pale as death. She was sobbing.  “‘But he is saved!’ I said, taking her hands.  “The unhappy child hardly had the courage to reply. The true report of Reichshofen had been placarded;MacMahon in retreat, the whole army crushed. We gazed at each other in consternation. She was indespair, thinking of her father. I trembled, thinking of the old man. He certainly could not stand this freshshock. And yet what were we to do? Leave him his joy, and the illusions which had revived him? But inthat case we must lie.  “‘Very well, I will lie!’ said the heroic girl, quickly wiping away her tears; and with radiant face sheentered her grandfather’s chamber.  “It was a hard task that she had undertaken. The first few days she had no great difficulty. The goodman’s brain was feeble, and he allowed himself to be deceived like a child. But with returning health hisideas became clearer. We had to keep him posted concerning the movement of the armies, to draw upmilitary bulletins for him. Really, it was pitiful to see that lovely child leaning night and day over hermap of Germany, pinning little flags upon it, and struggling to lay out a glorious campaign: Bazainebesieging Berlin, Froissart in Bavaria, MacMahon on the Baltic. For all this she asked my advice, and Iassisted her as well as I could; but it was the grandfather who was especially useful to us in thatimaginary invasion. He had conquered Germany so many times under the First Empire! He knew all thestrokes beforehand: ‘Now this is where they will go. Now this is what they will do’; and his anticipationswere always realised, which did not fail to make him very proud.  “Unlucky it was of no avail for us to take cities and win battles; we never went quickly enough for him.That old man was insatiable! Every day, when I arrived, I learned of some new military exploit.  “‘Doctor, we have taken Mayence,’ the girl would say to me, coming to meet me with a heart-brokensmile, and I would hear through the door a joyous voice shouting to me:  “‘They are getting on! They are getting on! In a week we shall be in Berlin!’  “At that moment the Prussians were only a week’s march from Paris. We asked ourselves at first if itwould be better to take him into the provinces; but as soon as we were outside the city, the state of thecountry would have told him everything, and I considered him still too weak, too much benumbed by hisgreat shock, to let him know the truth. So we decided to remain.  “The first day of the investment of Paris, I went up to their rooms, I remember, deeply moved, with thatagony at the heart which the closed gates, the fighting under the walls, and our suburbs turned intofrontiers, gave us all. I found the good man seated on his bed, proud and jubilant.  “‘Well,’ he said, ‘so the siege has begun!’  “I gazed at him in blank amazement.  “‘What, colonel! you know?’  “His granddaughter turned towards me:  “‘Why, yes, doctor, that’s the great news. The siege of Berlin has begun.’  “As she said this, she plied her needle with such a sedate and placid air! How could he have suspectedanything? He could not hear the guns of the forts. He could not see our unfortunate Paris, all in confusionand dreadful to behold. What he saw from his bed was a section of the Arc de Triomphe, and in his room,about him, a collection of bric-a-brac of the First Empire, well adapted to maintain his illusion. Portraitsof marshals, engravings of battles, the King of Rome in a baby’s dress, tall consoles adorned with coppertrophies, laden with imperial relics, medals, bronzes, a miniature of St. Helena, under a globe, picturesrepresenting the same lady all becurled, in a ball-dress of yellow, with leg-of-mutton sleeves and brighteyes;—and all these things: consoles, King of Rome, marshals, yellow ladies, with the high-necked,short-waisted dresses, the bestarched stiffness, which was the charm of 1806. Gallant colonel! It was thatatmosphere of victories and conquests, even more than anything we could say to him, that made himbelieve so innocently in the siege of Berlin.  “From that day our military operations were much simplified. To take Berlin was only a matter ofpatience. From time to time, when the old man was too much bored, we would read him a letter from hisson—an imaginary letter, of course, for nothing was allowed to enter Paris, and since Sedan,MacMahon’s aide-de-camp had been sent to a German fortress. You can imagine the despair of that poorchild, without news from her father, knowing that he was a prisoner, in need of everything, perhaps sick,and she obliged to represent him as writing joyful letters, a little short, perhaps, but such as a soldier onthe field might be expected to write, always marching forward through a conquered country. Sometimesher strength gave way; then they were without news for weeks. But the old man became anxious, couldnot sleep. Thereupon a letter from Germany would speedily arrive, which she would bring to his bedsideand read joyously, forcing back her tears. The colonel would listen religiously, smile with a knowing air,approve, criticise, and explain to us the passages that seemed a little confused. But where he wasespecially grand was in the replies that he sent to his son. ‘Never forget that you are a Frenchman,’ hewould say to him. ‘Be generous to those poor people. Don’t make the invasion too hard for them.’ Andthere were recommendations without end, admirable preachments upon respect for the proprieties, thecourtesy which should be shown to the ladies, a complete code of military honour for the use ofconquerors. He interspersed also some general considerations upon politics, the conditions of peace to beimposed upon the vanquished. Thereupon I must say that he was not exacting.  “‘A war indemnity, and nothing more. What is the use of taking their provinces? Is it possible to turnGermany into France?’  “He dictated this in a firm voice; and one was conscious of such candour in his words, of such a noble,patriotic faith, that it was impossible not to be moved while listening to him.  “Meanwhile the siege went on—not the siege of Berlin, alas! It was the time of intense cold, of thebombardment, of epidemics and of famine. But, thanks to our care, to our efforts, to the unwearyingaffection which multiplied itself about him, the old man’s serenity was not disturbed for an instant. Tothe very end I was able to obtain white bread and fresh meat for him. There was none for anybody buthim, to be sure; and you can imagine nothing more touching than those breakfasts of the grandfather, soinnocently selfish—the old man seated on his bed, fresh and smiling, with a napkin at his chin, and hisgranddaughter beside him, a little pale because of privations, guiding his hand, helping him to drink, andto eat all those forbidden good things. Then, enlivened by the repast, in the comfort of his warm room,the winter wind whistling outside and the snow eddying about his windows, the ex-cuirassier wouldrecall his campaigns in the north and would describe to us for the hundredth time that terrible retreatfrom Russia, when they had nothing to eat but frozen biscuit and horseflesh.  “‘Do you understand that, my love? We had horseflesh!’  “I rather think that she did understand it. For two months she had had nothing else. From that day,however, as the period of convalescence drew near, our task about the patient became more difficult.That numbness of all his senses, of all his members, which had served us so well hitherto, began todisappear. Two or three times, the terrible volleys from Porte Maillot had made him jump, with his earspricked up like a hunting-dog; we were obliged to invent a final victory of Bazaine under the walls ofBerlin, and guns fired in his honour at the Invalides. Another day when his bed had been moved to thewindow—it was, I believe, the Thursday of Buzenval—he saw large numbers of National Guardscollected on Avenue de la Grande Armée.  “‘What are all those troops?’ asked the good man; and we heard him mutter between his teeth:  “‘Poorly set up! Poorly set up!’  “That was all; but we understood that we must take great precautions thenceforth. Unluckily we did nottake enough.  “One evening when I arrived, the girl came to me in great trouble.  “‘They are to march into the city to-morrow,’ she said.  “Was the grandfather’s door open? In truth, on thinking it over afterwards, I remembered that his facewore an extraordinary expression that night. It is probable that he had overheard us. But we were talkingof the Prussians; and the good man was thinking of the French, of that triumphal entry which he had beenawaiting so long—MacMahon marching down the avenue amid flowers and flourishes of trumpets, hisson beside him, and he, the old colonel, on his balcony, in full uniform as at Lutzen, saluting the tornflags and the eagles blackened by powder.  “Poor Father Jouve! He had imagined doubtless that we intended to prevent him from witnessing thatparade of our troops, in order to avoid too great excitement. So he was very careful not to mention it toany one; but the next day, at the very hour when the Prussian battalions entered hesitatingly upon thelong road which leads from Porte Maillot to the Tuileries, the window up there opened softly, and thecolonel appeared on the balcony, with his helmet, his long sword, all the glorious old array of one ofMilhaud’s cuirassiers. I wonder still what effort of the will, what sudden outburst of life had placed himthus upon his feet and in his harness. This much is sure, that he was there, standing behind the rail,amazed to find the broad avenues so silent, the blinds of the houses closed, Paris as gloomy as a hugelazaretto, flags everywhere, but such strange flags, white with little crosses, and no one to go to meet oursoldiers.  “For a moment he might have thought that he was mistaken.  “But no! Yonder, behind the Arc de Triomphe, there was a confused rumbling, a black line approachingin the rising sunlight. Then, little by little, the points of the helmets gleamed, the little drums of Jenabegan to beat, and beneath the Arc de Triomphe, while the heavy tramp of the regiments and the clashingof the sabres beat time, Schubert’s Triumphal March burst forth!  “Thereupon in the deathlike silence of the square, a cry rang out, a terrible cry: ‘To arms! To arms! ThePrussians!’ and the four uhlans of the vanguard saw up yonder, on the balcony, a tall old man wave hisarms, stagger, and fall. That time, Colonel Jouve was really dead.”\n"

            " I WAS very late for school that morning, and I was terribly afraid of being scolded, especially asMonsieur Hamel had told us that he should examine us on participles, and I did not know the first thingabout them. For a moment I thought of staying away from school and wandering about the fields. It wassuch a warm, lovely day. I could hear the blackbirds whistling on the edge of the wood, and in theRippert field, behind the sawmill, the Prussians going through their drill. All that was much moretempting to me than the rules concerning participles; but I had the strength to resist, and I ran as fast as Icould to school.  As I passed the mayor’s office, I saw that there were people gathered about the little board on whichnotices were posted. For two years all our bad news had come from that board—battles lost,conscriptions, orders from headquarters; and I thought without stopping:  “What can it be now?”  Then, as I ran across the square, Wachter the blacksmith, who stood there with his apprentice, readingthe placard, called out to me:  “Don’t hurry so, my boy; you’ll get to your school soon enough!”  I thought that he was making fun of me, and I ran into Monsieur Hamel’s little yard all out of breath.  Usually, at the beginning of school, there was a great uproar which could be heard in the street, desksopening and closing, lessons repeated aloud in unison, with our ears stuffed in order to learn quicker, andthe teacher’s stout ruler beating on the desk:  “A little more quiet!”  I counted on all this noise to reach my bench unnoticed; but as it happened, that day everything wasquiet, like a Sunday morning. Through the open window I saw my comrades already in their places, andMonsieur Hamel walking back and forth with the terrible iron ruler under his arm. I had no open the doorand enter, in the midst of that perfect silence. You can imagine whether I blushed and whether I wasafraid!  But no! Monsieur Hamel looked at me with no sign of anger and said very gently:  “Go at once to your seat, my little Frantz; we were going to begin without you.”  I stepped over the bench and sat down at once at my desk. Not until then, when I had partly recoveredfrom my fright, did I notice that our teacher had on his handsome blue coat, his plaited ruff, and the blacksilk embroidered breeches, which he wore only on days of inspection or of distribution of prizes.Moreover, there was something extraordinary, something solemn about the whole class. But whatsurprised me most was to see at the back of the room, on the benches which were usually empty, somepeople from the village sitting, as silent as we were: old Hauser with his three-cornered hat, theex-mayor, the ex-postman, and others besides. They all seemed depressed; and Hauser had brought anold spelling-book with gnawed edges, which he held wide-open on his knee, with his great spectaclesaskew.  While I was wondering at all this, Monsieur Hamel had mounted his platform, and in the same gentleand serious voice with which he had welcomed me, he said to us:  “My children, this is the last time that I shall teach you. Orders have come from Berlin to teach nothingbut German in the schools of Alsace and Lorraine. The new teacher arrives to-morrow. This is the lastclass in French, so I beg you to be very attentive.”  Those few words overwhelmed me. Ah! the villains! that was what they had posted at the mayor’soffice.  My last class in French!  And I barely knew how to write! So I should never learn! I must stop short where I was! How angry Iwas with myself because of the time I had wasted, the lessons I had missed, running about after nests, orsliding on the Saar! My books, which only a moment before I thought so tiresome, so heavy tocarry—my grammar, my sacred history—seemed to me now like old friends, from whom I should beterribly grieved to part. And it was the same about Monsieur Hamel. The thought that he was goingaway, that I should never see him again, made me forget the punishments, the blows with the ruler.  Poor man! It was in honour of that last lesson that he had put on his fine Sunday clothes; and Iunderstood now why those old fellows from the village were sitting at the end of the room. It seemed tomean that they regretted not having come oftener to the school. It was also a way of thanking our teacherfor his forty years of faithful service, and of paying their respects to the fatherland which was vanishing.  I was at that point in my reflections, when I heard my name called. It was my turn to recite. What wouldI not have given to be able to say from beginning to end that famous rule about participles, in a loud,distinct voice, without a slip! But I got mixed up at the first words, and I stood there swaying against mybench, with a full heart, afraid to raise my head. I heard Monsieur Hamel speaking to me:  “I will not scold you, my little Frantz; you must be punished enough; that is the way it goes; every daywe say to ourselves: ‘Pshaw! I have time enough. I will learn to-morrow.’ And then you see whathappens. Ah! it has been the great misfortune of our Alsace always to postpone its lessons untilto-morrow. Now those people are entitled to say to us: ‘What! you claim to be French, and you canneither speak nor write your language!’ In all this, my poor Frantz, you are not the guiltiest one. We allhave our fair share of reproaches to address to ourselves.  “Your parents have not been careful enough to see that you were educated. They preferred to send youto work in the fields or in the factories, in order to have a few more sous. And have I nothing to reproachmyself for? Have I not often made you water my garden instead of studying? And when I wanted to gofishing for trout, have I ever hesitated to dismiss you?”  Then, passing from one thing to another, Monsieur Hamel began to talk to us about the Frenchlanguage, saying that it was the most beautiful language in the world, the most clear, the mostsubstantial; that we must always retain it among ourselves, and never forget it, because when a peoplefalls into servitude, “so long as it clings to its language, it is as if it held the key to its prison.” 1 Then hetook the grammer and read us our lesson. I was amazed to see how readily I understood. Everything thathe said seemed so easy to me, so easy. I believed, too, that I had never listened so closely, and that he, forhis part, had never been so patient with his explanations. One would have said that, before going away,the poor man desired to give us all his knowledge, to force it all into our heads at a single blow.  When the lesson was at an end, we passed to writing. For that day Monsieur Hamel had prepared someentirely new examples, on which was written in a fine, round hand: “France, Alsace, France, Alsace.”They were like little flags, waving all about the class, hanging from the rods of our desks. You shouldhave seen how hard we all worked and how silent it was! Nothing could be heard save the grinding of thepens over the paper. At one time some cock-chafers flew in; but no one paid any attention to them, noteven the little fellows who were struggling with their straight lines, with a will and conscientiousapplication, as if even the lines were French. On the roof of the schoolhouse, pigeons cooed in low tones,and I said to myself as I listened to them:  “I wonder if they are going to compel them to sing in German too!”  From time to time, when I raised my eyes from my paper. I saw Monsieur Hamel sitting motionless inhis chair and staring at the objects about him as if he wished to carry away in his glance the whole of hislittle schoolhouse. Think of it! For forty years he had been there in the same place, with his yard in frontof him and his class just as it was! But the benches and desks were polished and rubbed by use; thewalnuts in the yard had grown, and the hop-vine which he himself had planted now festooned thewindows even to the roof. What a heart-rending thing it must have been for that poor man to leave allthose things, and to hear his sister walking back and forth in the room overhead, packing their trunks! Forthey were to go away the next day—to leave the province forever.  However, he had the courage to keep the class to the end. After the writing, we had the lesson inhistory; then the little ones sang all together the ba, be, bi, bo, bu. Yonder, at the back of the room, oldHauser had put on his spectacles, and, holding his spelling-book in both hands, he spelled out the letterswith them. I could see that he too was applying himself. His voice shook with emotion, and it was sofunny to hear him, that we all longed to laugh and to cry. Ah! I shall remember that last class.  Suddenly the church clock struck twelve, then the Angelus rang. At the same moment, the bugles of thePrussians returning from drill blared under our windows. Monsieur Hamel rose, pale as death, from hischair. Never had he seemed to me so tall.  “My friends,” he said, “my friends, I—I—”  But something suffocated him. He could not finish the sentence.  Thereupon he turned to the blackboard, took a piece of chalk, and, bearing on with all his might, hewrote in the largest letters he could:  “VIVE LA FRANCE!”  Then he stood there, with his head resting against the wall, and without speaking, he motioned to uswith his hand:  “That is all; go.”\n"

Basedon the different error profiles we show that YOLO can beused to rescore Fast R-CNN detections and reduce the er-rors from background false positives, giving a significantperformance boost. We also present VOC 2012 results andcompare mAP to current state-of-the-art methods. Finally,we show that YOLO generalizes to new domains better thanother detectors on two artwork datasets.\n"
